Organizations face a similar dilemma right now at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity. AI adoption creates an inevitable paradox: delaying it poses strategic risks, rushing it introduces poorly understood vulnerabilities, and even incremental adoption leads to cascading complexities. In this work we formalize this challenge as the AI Security Zugzwang, a phenomenon where security leaders must make decisions under conditions of inevitable risk. Grounded in game theory, security economics, and organizational decision theory, we characterize AI security zugzwang through three key properties, the forced movement, predictable vulnerability creation, and temporal pressure. Additionally, we develop a taxonomy to categorize forced-move scenarios across AI adoption, implementation, operational and governance contexts and provide corresponding strategic mitigations.

While pressing, this narrow focus overlooks critical human-centric considerations that shape the long-term trajectory of a society. In this position paper, we identify the risks of overlooking the impact of AI on the future of work and recommend comprehensive transition support towards the evolution of meaningful labor with human agency. Through the lens of economic theories, we highlight the intertemporal impacts of AI on human livelihood and the structural changes in labor markets that exacerbate income inequality. Additionally, the closed-source approach of major stakeholders in AI development resembles rent-seeking behavior through exploiting resources, breeding mediocrity in creative labor, and monopolizing innovation. To address this, we argue in favor of a robust international copyright anatomy supported by implementing collective licensing that ensures fair compensation mechanisms for using data to train AI models.

In this paper, we present a holistic cyber security review that demonstrates adversarial attacks against AI applications, including aspects such as adversarial knowledge and capabilities, as well as existing methods for generating adversarial examples and existing cyber defence models. We explain mathematical AI models, especially new variants of reinforcement and federated learning, to demonstrate how attack vectors would exploit vulnerabilities of AI models. We also propose a systematic framework for demonstrating attack techniques against AI applications and reviewed several cyber defences that would protect AI applications against those attacks.

However, their deployment is increasingly constrained by substantial computational demands, specifically for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) resources. This paper addresses the critical problem of optimizing resource utilization in LLM agent systems. We introduce COALESCE (Cost-Optimized and Secure Agent Labour Exchange via Skill-based Competence Estimation), a novel framework designed to enable autonomous LLM agents to dynamically outsource specific subtasks to specialized, cost-effective third-party LLM agents. The framework integrates mechanisms for hybrid skill representation, dynamic skill discovery, automated task decomposition, a unified cost model comparing internal execution costs against external outsourcing prices, simplified market-based decision-making algorithms, and a standardized communication protocol between LLM agents. Comprehensive validation through 239 theoretical simulations demonstrates 41.8\% cost reduction potential, while large-scale empirical validation across 240 real LLM tasks confirms 20.3\% cost reduction with proper epsilon-greedy exploration, establishing both theoretical viability and practical effectiveness. The emergence of proposed open standards like Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol further underscores the need for frameworks like COALESCE that can leverage such standards for efficient agent interaction. By facilitating a dynamic market for agent capabilities, potentially utilizing protocols like A2A for communication, COALESCE aims to significantly reduce operational costs, enhance system scalability, and foster the emergence of specialized agent economies, making complex LLM agent functionalities more accessible and economically viable.","2025-06-02","2025-07-17 05:02:55","2025-07-17 05:02:55","2025-07-17 05:02:55","","","","","","","COALESCE","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2506.01900 [cs]","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\YLMQNPTI\Bhatt et al. - 2025 - COALESCE Economic and Security Dynamics of Skill-Based Task Outsourcing Among Team of Autonomous LL.pdf","","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science; Computer Science - Cryptography and Security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2506.01900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents an in-depth analysis of frontier AI's impact on cybersecurity and establishes a systematic framework for risk assessment and mitigation. To this end, we first define and categorize the marginal risks of frontier AI in cybersecurity and then systemically analyze the current and future impacts of frontier AI in cybersecurity, qualitatively and quantitatively. We also discuss why frontier AI likely benefits attackers more than defenders in the short term from equivalence classes, asymmetry, and economic impact. Next, we explore frontier AI's impact on future software system development, including enabling complex hybrid systems while introducing new risks. Based on our findings, we provide security recommendations, including constructing fine-grained benchmarks for risk assessment, designing AI agents for defenses, building security mechanisms and provable defenses for hybrid systems, enhancing pre-deployment security testing and transparency, and strengthening defenses for users.

"NE5MEKTM","journalArticle","","Acemoglu, Daron","The Simple Macroeconomics of AI","","","","","","This paper evaluates claims about the large macroeconomic implications of new advances in AI. It starts from a task-based model of AI’s eﬀects, working through automation and task complementarities. It establishes that, so long as AI’s microeconomic eﬀects are driven by cost savings/productivity improvements at the task level, its macroeconomic consequences will be given by a version of Hulten’s theorem: GDP and aggregate productivity gains can be estimated by what fraction of tasks are impacted and average task-level cost savings. Using existing estimates on exposure to AI and productivity improvements at the task level, these macroeconomic eﬀects appear nontrivial but modest—no more than a 0.71% increase in total factor productivity over 10 years. The paper then argues that even these estimates could be exaggerated, because early evidence is from easy-to-learn tasks, whereas some of the future eﬀects will come from hard-to-learn tasks, where there are many context-dependent factors aﬀecting decision-making and no objective outcome measures from which to learn successful performance. Consequently, predicted TFP gains over the next 10 years are even more modest and are predicted to be less than 0.55%. I also explore AI’s wage and inequality eﬀects. I show theoretically that even when AI improves the productivity of low-skill workers in certain tasks (without creating new tasks for them), this may increase rather than reduce inequality. Empirically, I ﬁnd that AI advances are unlikely to increase inequality as much as previous automation technologies because their impact is more equally distributed across demographic groups, but there is also no evidence that AI will reduce labor income inequality. AI is also predicted to widen the gap between capital and labor income. Finally, some of the new tasks created by AI may have negative social value (such as design of algorithms for online manipulation), and I discuss how to incorporate the macroeconomic eﬀects of new tasks that may have negative social value.","","2025-07-17 05:03:14","2025-07-17 05:03:14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\TAAGRRQK\Acemoglu - The Simple Macroeconomics of AI.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Game theory has been proven as a very effective tool in modelling the decision-making processes of intelligent agents, entities, and players. It has been used to model scenarios from diverse fields such as economics, evolutionary biology, and computer science. In defence applications, there is often a need to model and predict the actions of hostile actors, and players who try to evade or out-smart each other. Modelling how the actions of competitive players shape the decision making of each other is the forte of game theory. In past decades, there have been several studies that applied different branches of game theory to model a range of defence-related scenarios. This paper provides a structured review of such attempts, and classifies existing literature in terms of the kind of warfare modelled, the types of games used, and the players involved. After careful selection, a total of 29 directly relevant papers are discussed and classified. In terms of the warfares modelled, we recognise that most papers that apply game theory in defence settings are concerned with Command and Control Warfare, and can be further classified into papers dealing with (i) Resource Allocation Warfare (ii) Information Warfare (iii) Weapons Control Warfare, and (iv) Adversary Monitoring Warfare. We also observe that most of the reviewed papers are concerned with sensing, tracking, and large sensor networks, and the studied problems have parallels in sensor network analysis in the civilian domain. In terms of the games used, we classify the reviewed papers into papers that use non-cooperative or cooperative games, simultaneous or sequential games, discrete or continuous games, and non-zero-sum or zero-sum games. Similarly, papers are also classified into two-player, three-player or multi-player game based papers. We also explore the nature of players and the construction of payoff functions in each scenario. Finally, we also identify gaps in literature where game theory could be fruitfully applied in scenarios hitherto unexplored using game theory. The presented analysis provides a concise summary of the state-of-the-art with regards to the use of game theory in defence applications and highlights the benefits and limitations of game theory in the considered scenarios.","2022-01-28","2025-07-17 05:04:26","2025-07-17 05:04:26","2025-07-17 05:04:26","1032","","3","22","","Sensors (Basel)","Game Theory in Defence Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 35161778 PMCID: PMC8838118","","","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8838118/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing works have only analyzed MIA in a single interaction scenario between an adversary and the target ML model, missing the factors that influence an adversary’s capability to launch MIA in repeated interactions. These works also assume the attacker knows the model’s structure, which isn’t always true, leading to suboptimal thresholds for identifying members. This paper examines explanation-based threshold attacks, where an adversary uses the variance in explanations through repeated interactions to perform MIA. We use a continuous-time stochastic signaling game to model these interactions. Unaware of the system’s exact type (honest or malicious), the adversary plays a stopping game to gather explanation variance and compute an optimal threshold for membership determination. We propose a sound mathematical formulation to prove that such an optimal threshold exists, which can be used to launch MIA and identify conditions for a unique Markov perfect equilibrium in this dynamic system. Finally, we evaluate various factors affecting an adversary’s ability to conduct MIA in repeated settings through simulations.","2025","2025-07-17 05:05:59","2025-07-17 05:05:59","","263-283","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Nature Switzerland","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Sinha, Arunesh; Fu, Jie; Zhu, Quanyan; Zhang, Tao","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To prevent the server from linking the sender and the receiver, the latter can set how much cover traffic they should download along with genuine messages. Clearly, this could cause unwanted messages to appear on the user’s end, thereby creating a need to balance one’s bandwidth cost with the desired level of unlinkability.","2025","2025-07-17 05:05:59","2025-07-17 05:05:59","","240-259","","","","","","Effective Anonymous Messaging","","","","","Springer Nature Switzerland","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Sinha, Arunesh; Fu, Jie; Zhu, Quanyan; Zhang, Tao","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We extend these models by proposing K-hop network (security) games, in which agents have extended awareness of network effects: an agent in a K-hop network game accounts for not only its immediate neighbors (those with whom it directly has joint operations or shared infrastructure), but also the spillover of the (security) risks from agents up to K-hops away from it. We first establish an equivalence between our proposed K-hop network games and a one-hop game played on an appropriately defined adjacency matrix. Then, through analytical results and numerical examples, we illustrate how subtle changes in a network can significantly alter equilibrium behaviors when accounting for multi-hop risk spillovers, emphasizing the dependency of agents’ efforts on the nature of their dependencies (complement vs. substitute nature of efforts), agents’ different levels K of awareness of the network effects, and the reactive vs. passive nature of lower awareness (lower K) agents to those with higher awareness (higher K). Our findings show that extended awareness of network effects can, in general, benefit agents by allowing them to optimize their security planning and resource allocation, but that decision makers who are less sophisticated and lack this awareness can suffer, and that consequently, overall investment levels in security may deteriorate.","2025","2025-07-17 05:05:59","2025-07-17 05:05:59","","201-219","","","","","","Extended Horizons","","","","","Springer Nature Switzerland","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Sinha, Arunesh; Fu, Jie; Zhu, Quanyan; Zhang, Tao","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One potential impact is on cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, which relies on proof-of-work mining to secure the underlying blockchain protocol. Miners empowered by quantum computers will have superior computational power to win the competition. The quantum advantage jeopardizes the security and trustworthy of cryptocurrency and the transaction validation process by taking over a majority of the network’s computing power, known as a $$51\%$$51%attack. Fraudulent Bitcoin transactions in the form of double spending can happen, and the emerging quantum miner could enable double spending and benefit from it. How much double spending is optimal without causing too much “inflation”? What shall be the optimal strategy of the first quantum miner facing the competition from other quantum miners? What are the implications of having one or multiple quantum miners to the security of the Bitcoin network? We conduct a novel game theoretic and economic analysis to address these questions. Simulation illustrates that quantum miners would have to collude to gain from double spending in a quantum competitive environment. The distribution of cryptocurrency between quantum miners and classical miners and how cost-effective classical miners are can affect the profitability and the sustainability of double spending as well as the collusion of quantum miners. Intensified quantum competition will decrease the chance of collusion and eventually make the Bitcoin network secure again. The critical point of quantum popularity that will eliminate double spending is found.","2025","2025-07-17 05:05:59","2025-07-17 05:05:59","","87-106","","","","","","How Much Should I Double Spend My Bitcoin?","","","","","Springer Nature Switzerland","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Sinha, Arunesh; Fu, Jie; Zhu, Quanyan; Zhang, Tao","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We consider a team of agents deceiving their supervisor. The supervisor defines nominal behavior for the agents via reference policies, but the agents share an alternate task that they can only achieve by deviating from these references. As such, the agents use deceptive policies to complete the task while ensuring that their behaviors remain plausible to the supervisor. We propose a setting with centralized deceptive policy synthesis and decentralized execution. We model each agent with a Markov decision process and constrain the agents’ deceptive policies so that, with high probability, at least one agent achieves the task. We then provide an algorithm to synthesize deceptive policies that ensure the deviations of all agents are small by minimizing the worst Kullback-Leibler divergence between any agent’s deceptive and reference policies. Thanks to decentralization, this algorithm scales linearly with the number of agents and also facilitates the efficient synthesis of reference policies. We then explore a more general version of the deceptive policy synthesis problem. In particular, we consider a supervisor who selects a subset of agents to eliminate based on the agents’ behaviors. We give algorithms to synthesize deceptive policies so that, after the supervisor eliminates some agents, the remaining agents complete the task with high probability.

Traditional cyber defense mechanisms fail to pose dynamic measures to stop ransomware attacks from progressing through various stages in the attack process. To this end, intelligent cyber deception strategies can be effective when they leverage information about attacker strategies and deploy deceptive assets to increase the cost or complexity of a successful exploit or discourage continued attacker efforts. In this paper, we present a novel game theoretic approach that uses deception-based defense strategies at each of the ransomware attack stages for optimization of the decision-making to outsmart attacker advances. Specifically, we propose a multistage ransomware game model that deploys a combination of deception assets i.e., honeytokens, honeypots, honeyfiles, and network honeypots in subgames. Using closed-form backward induction, we evaluated Subgame-Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE). We perform a numerical analysis using real-world data and statistics pertaining to the impact of ransomware attacks in the healthcare sector. Our healthcare case study evaluation results show that the use of deception technologies is favorable to the defender. This work elucidates the profound implications of strategic deception in cybersecurity, demonstrating its capacity to complicate successful exploits and consequently bolster the defense of key societal infrastructures.","2025","2025-07-17 05:05:59","2025-07-17 05:05:59","","149-176","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Nature Switzerland","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Sinha, Arunesh; Fu, Jie; Zhu, Quanyan; Zhang, Tao","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current trends in automated penetration testing are also impractical, facing significant challenges such as the curse of dimensionality, scalability issues, and lack of adaptability to network changes. To address these issues, we propose MEGA-PT, a meta-game penetration testing framework, featuring micro tactic games for node-level local interactions and a macro strategy process for network-wide attack chains. The micro- and macro-level modeling enables distributed, adaptive, collaborative, and fast penetration testing. MEGA-PT offers agile solutions for various security schemes, including optimal local penetration plans, purple teaming solutions, and risk assessment, providing fundamental principles to guide future automated penetration testing.

State-of-the-art intrusion-tolerant systems can be understood as instantiations of our game with heuristic control strategies. Our analysis shows the conditions under which such heuristics can be significantly improved through game-theoretic reasoning. This reasoning allows us to derive the optimal control strategies and evaluate them against 10 types of network intrusions on a testbed. The testbed results demonstrate that our game-theoretic strategies can significantly improve service availability and reduce the operational cost of state-of-the-art intrusion-tolerant systems.

This model captures the interactions between a defender and an adversary who strategically take over nodes in a graph to minimize (resp. maximize) a finite horizon additive cost. At any time, the FlipDyn state is represented as the current node, and each player can transition the FlipDyn state to a node based on the connectivity from the current node. Such transitions are driven by the node dynamics, state, and node-dependent costs. This model results in a hybrid dynamical system where the discrete state (FlipDyn state) governs the continuous state evolution and the corresponding state cost. Our objective is to compute the Nash equilibrium of this finite horizon zero-sum game on a graph. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we model and characterize the FlipDyn-G game for general dynamical systems, along with the corresponding Nash equilibrium (NE) takeover strategies. Second, for scalar linear discrete-time dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we derive the NE takeover strategies and saddle-point values independent of the continuous state of the system. Additionally, for a finite state birth-death Markov chain (represented as a graph) under scalar linear dynamical systems, we derive analytical expressions for the NE takeover strategies and saddle-point values.

Zero-day attacks exploit unknown vulnerabilities and give attackers the upper hand against conventional defenses. Honeypots have been used to deceive attackers by misrepresenting the true state of the network. Existing work on cyber deception does not model zero-day attacks. In this paper, we address the question of “How to allocate honeypots over the network?” to protect its most valuable assets. To this end, we develop a two-player zero-sum game theoretic approach to study the potential reconnaissance tracks and attack paths that attackers may use. However, zero-day attacks allow attackers to avoid placed honeypots by creating new attack paths. Therefore, we introduce a sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of different zero-day vulnerabilities on the performance of the proposed deception technique. Next, we propose several mitigating strategies to defend the network against zero-day attacks based on this analysis.

The involvement of a predictive model learned from adversary’s behavior data poses a critical threat that an adversary can influence the learning process, which will ultimately deteriorate the end-goal decision quality. In this paper, we study the problem of poisoning attacks in this data-based decision making setting. That is, the adversary can alter the training data by injecting some perturbation into the data to a certain limit that can substantially change the final decision outcome in the end towards the adversary goal. To our knowledge, this is the first work that studies poisoning attacks in such data-based decision making scenarios. In particular, we provide the following main contributions. We introduce a new meta-gradient based poisoning attack for various types of predict and optimize frameworks. We compare to a technique shown effective in computer vision. We find that the complexity of the problem makes attacking decision focused model difficult.

To obtain robust MTD in the face of unknown attack strategies, a promising approach is to model the sequential attacker-defender interactions as a two-player Markov game, and formulate the defender’s problem as finding the Stackelberg equilibrium (or a variant of it) with the defender and the leader and the attacker as the follower. To solve the game, however, existing approaches typically assume that the attacker type (including its physical, cognitive, and computational abilities and constraints) is known or is sampled from a known distribution. The former rarely holds in practice as the initial guess about the attacker type is often inaccurate, while the latter leads to suboptimal solutions even when there is no distribution shift between when the MTD policy is trained and when it is applied. On the other hand, it is often infeasible to collect enough samples covering various attack scenarios on the fly in security-sensitive domains. To address this dilemma, we propose a two-stage meta-reinforcement learning based MTD framework in this work. At the training stage, a meta-MTD policy is learned using experiences sampled from a set of possible attacks. At the test stage, the meta-policy is quickly adapted against a real attack using a small number of samples. We show that our two-stage MTD defense obtains superb performance in the face of uncertain/unknown attacker type and attack behavior.","2023","2025-07-17 05:08:51","2025-07-17 05:08:51","","107-126","","","","","","Robust Moving Target Defense Against Unknown Attacks","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Fang, Fei; Xu, Haifeng; Hayel, Yezekael","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we focus on understanding human attacker behaviors in order to optimize the defender’s strategy. To achieve this goal, we model attacker-defender engagements as Markov Games and search for their Bayesian Stackelberg Equilibrium. We validate our modeling approach and report our empirical findings using a Capture-The-Flag (CTF) setup, and we conduct user studies on adversaries with varying skill-levels. Our studies show that application-level deceptions are an optimal mitigation strategy against targeted attacks—outperforming classic cyber-defensive maneuvers, such as patching or blocking network requests.

Stackelberg games are of particular popularity as models for security since they well describe adversaries that adapt to the defender’s actions. Games in extensive or normal form herein induce a fixed sequence of when players become active. But why would a player in a security game wait for the opponent’s move and not just take further actions to cause more damage or gain more? This work studies generalized interaction patterns motivated from the security context, in which each player can take actions as often as it likes, and receives a payoff from the game upon every activity. The practical scenario motivating this study is an adversary who does not wait for the defender to take action, but rather makes the most of the periods during which the defender is idle. This can mean to learn as possible about the victim system while the defender is not present, or to cause as much damage as possible before the defender can strike back.","2023","2025-07-17 05:08:51","2025-07-17 05:08:51","","129-148","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Fang, Fei; Xu, Haifeng; Hayel, Yezekael","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a clever attacker can intentionally change its behavior to mislead the defender’s learning, leading to an ineffective defense strategy. This paper investigates the attacker’s imitative behavior deception under uncertainty, in which the attacker mimics a (deceptive) behavior model by consistently playing according to that model, given that it is uncertain about the defender’s learning outcome. We have three main contributions. First, we introduce a new maximin-based algorithm to compute a robust attacker deception decision. Second, we propose a new counter-deception algorithm to tackle the attacker’s deception.

This paper studies a class of probabilistic planning problems with intention deception and investigates how a defender’s limited sensing modality can be exploited by an attacker to achieve its attack objective almost surely (with probability one) while hiding its intention. In particular, we model the attack planning in a stochastic system modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). The attacker is to reach some target states while avoiding unsafe states in the system and knows that his behavior is monitored by a defender with partial observations. Given partial state observations for the defender, we develop qualitative intention deception planning algorithms that construct attack strategies to play against an action-visible defender and an action-invisible defender, respectively. The synthesized attack strategy not only ensures the attack objective is satisfied almost surely but also deceives the defender into believing that the observed behavior is generated by a normal/legitimate user and thus failing to detect the presence of an attack. We show the proposed algorithms are correct and complete and illustrate the deceptive planning methods with examples.","2023","2025-07-17 05:08:51","2025-07-17 05:08:51","","67-86","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Fang, Fei; Xu, Haifeng; Hayel, Yezekael","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of the attacker is to infect a maximum number of nodes at a given instant, and then a state-extended stochastic game framework is proposed in order to get optimality equations.

The trackers rely on individual measurements of the location of the target using, for instance, their individual distance to the target and are assumed to be slower than the pursuer. The pursuer seeks to minimize the square of the instantaneous distance to one of the trackers, while the trackers aim to jointly maximize a weighted combination of the determinant of the Fisher Information Matrix and the square of the distance between the pursuer and the tracker being pursued. This formulation models the objective of the trackers which is to maximize the information gathered about the target, while delaying capture. We show that the optimization problem for the trackers can be transformed into a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program. We then establish that the game admits a Nash equilibrium in the space of pure strategies and provide several numerical insights into the trajectories and the payoff of the mobile agents. Finally, we outline how this work can be generalized to the case of multiple trackers and multiple targets.","2023","2025-07-17 05:08:51","2025-07-17 05:08:51","","168-187","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Fang, Fei; Xu, Haifeng; Hayel, Yezekael","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present novel attacks targeting Q-learning that exploit a vulnerability entailed by this assumption by delaying the reward signal for a limited time period. We consider two types of attack goals: targeted attacks, which aim to cause a target policy to be learned, and untargeted attacks, which simply aim to induce a policy with a low reward. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed attacks through a series of experiments. Our first observation is that reward-delay attacks are extremely effective when the goal is simply to minimize reward. Indeed, we find that even naive baseline reward-delay attacks are also highly successful in minimizing the reward. Targeted attacks, on the other hand, are more challenging, although we nevertheless demonstrate that the proposed approaches remain highly effective at achieving the attacker’s targets. In addition, we introduce a second threat model that captures a minimal mitigation that ensures that rewards cannot be used out of sequence. We find that this mitigation remains insufficient to ensure robustness to attacks that delay, but preserve the order, of rewards.","2023","2025-07-17 05:08:51","2025-07-17 05:08:51","","212-230","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Fang, Fei; Xu, Haifeng; Hayel, Yezekael","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These games typically have a highly complicated structure of Nash equilibria, and numerical methods for the equilibrium computation are known only for particular classes of continuous games, such as two-player polynomial games or games in which pure equilibria are guaranteed to exist. This contribution focuses on the computation and approximation of a mixed strategy equilibrium for the whole class of multiplayer general-sum continuous games. We vastly extend the scope of applicability of the double oracle algorithm, initially designed and proved to converge only for two-player zero-sum games. Specifically, we propose an iterative strategy generation technique, which splits the original problem into the master problem with only a finite subset of strategies being considered, and the subproblem in which an oracle finds the best response of each player. This simple method is guaranteed to recover an approximate equilibrium in finitely many iterations. Further, we argue that the Wasserstein distance (the earth mover’s distance) is the right metric for the space of mixed strategies for our purposes. Our main result is the convergence of this algorithm in the Wasserstein distance to an equilibrium of the original continuous game. The numerical experiments show the performance of our method on several classes of games including randomly generated examples.","2023","2025-07-17 05:08:51","2025-07-17 05:08:51","","149-167","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Fang, Fei; Xu, Haifeng; Hayel, Yezekael","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Informational attacks have emerged as the prominent ones that aim to poison traffic data, misguide users, and manipulate traffic patterns. To study the impact of this class of attacks, we propose a game-theoretic framework where the attacker, as a Stackelberg leader, falsifies the traffic conditions to change the traffic pattern predicted by the Wardrop traffic equilibrium, achieved by the users, or the followers. The intended shift of the Wardrop equilibrium is a consequence of strategic informational poisoning. Leveraging game-theoretic and sensitivity analysis, we quantify the system-level impact of the attack by characterizing the concept of poisoned Price of Anarchy, which compares the poisoned Wardrop equilibrium and its non-poisoned system optimal counterpart. We use an evacuation case study to show that the Stackelberg equilibrium can be found through a two-time scale zeroth-order learning process and demonstrate the disruptive effects of informational poisoning, indicating a compelling need for defense policies to mitigate such security threats.","2023","2025-07-17 05:08:51","2025-07-17 05:08:51","","191-211","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Fang, Fei; Xu, Haifeng; Hayel, Yezekael","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present an algorithm for approximating Nash equilibrium in multiplayer general-sum stochastic games with persistent imperfect information that extends throughout game play.

An important approach for mitigating this threat is remote attestation, which enables the defender to remotely verify the integrity of devices and their software. There are a number of approaches for remote attestation, and each has its unique advantages and disadvantages in terms of detection accuracy and computational cost. Further, an attestation method may be applied in multiple ways, such as various levels of software coverage. Therefore, to minimize both security risks and computational overhead, defenders need to decide strategically which attestation methods to apply and how to apply them, depending on the characteristic of the devices and the potential losses.","2021","2025-07-17 05:09:03","2025-07-17 05:09:03","","271-290","","","","","","Strategic Remote Attestation","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bošanský, Branislav; Gonzalez, Cleotilde; Rass, Stefan; Sinha, Arunesh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We scrutinize these assumptions and propose the advanced adversarial classification game, which incorporates all relevant parameters of an adversary and a defender.

One way deception can be employed is through obscuring, or masking, some of the information about how systems are configured, increasing attacker’s uncertainty about their targets. We present a novel game-theoretic model of the resulting defender-attacker interaction, where the defender chooses a subset of attributes to mask, while the attacker responds by choosing an exploit to execute. The strategies of both players have combinatorial structure with complex informational dependencies, and therefore even representing these strategies is not trivial. First, we show that the problem of computing an equilibrium of the resulting zero-sum defender-attacker game can be represented as a linear program with a combinatorial number of system configuration variables and constraints, and develop a constraint generation approach for solving this problem. Next, we present a novel highly scalable approach for approximately solving such games by representing the strategies of both players as neural networks. The key idea is to represent the defender’s mixed strategy using a deep neural network generator, and then using alternating gradient-descent-ascent algorithm, analogous to the training of Generative Adversarial Networks.

However, this presents a vulnerability: a clever attacker may change its own behavior during learning, leading to an inaccurate model and ineffective defender strategies. In this paper, we investigate how a wary defender can defend against such deceptive attacker. We provide four main contributions. First, we develop a new technique to estimate attacker true behavior despite data manipulation by the clever adversary. Second, we extend this technique to be viable even when the defender has access to a minimal amount of historical data. Third, we utilize a maximin approach to optimize the defender’s strategy against the worst-case within the estimate uncertainty.

Ransomware is a cryptoviral extortion attack that involves two phases: the cyber infection of the malware and the financial transaction of the ransom payment. As the ransomware attackers are financially motivated, the protection of the infrastructure networked systems requires a cross-layer risk analysis that not only examines the vulnerability of the cyber system but also consolidates the economics of ransom payment. To this end, this paper establishes a two-player multi-phase and multi-stage game framework to model cyber and economic phases of a ransomware attack. We use a zero-sum Markov game to capture the multi-stage penetration of ransomware in the lateral movement. A sequential-move game is proposed to model the ransom payment interactions at the second phase. Two games are composed to form a multi-phase and multi-stage game-in-games (MPMS-GiG) that enables a holistic risk assessment of ransomware in networks and a cross-layer design of cyber defense and investment strategies to mitigate the attack. We provide a complete equilibrium characterization of ransomware game and design interdependent optimal strategies for cyber protection and ransom payment. We use prospect theory to analyze the impact of human factors on equilibrium strategies. Finally, we use a prototypical industrial IoT network as a case study to corroborate the results.","2021","2025-07-17 05:09:03","2025-07-17 05:09:03","","208-228","","","","","","Combating Ransomware in Internet of Things","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bošanský, Branislav; Gonzalez, Cleotilde; Rass, Stefan; Sinha, Arunesh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such approaches can provide advantages to defenders by detecting inadvertent attacker interactions with decoy systems, by delaying attacker forward progress, by decreasing or eliminating attacker payoffs in multi-round interactions, and by predicting and interfering with (or incentivizing) likely attacker actions (probe, attack, and walk-away). In this work, we extend our prior model by examining the ability of a defender to learn an attacker’s preferences through observations of their interactions with targeted systems. Knowledge of an attacker’s preferences can be used to guide defensive systems, particularly those which present deceptive features to an attacker. Prior work did not distinguish between targets other than as real or decoy and only modeled an attacker’s behaviors as it related to their costs for probing or attacking defended systems. While this was able to predict an attacker’s likelihood of continuing their interactions or walking away from the game, it did not inform a defender as to an attacker’s likely future actions as expressed through preferences for various defended systems. In this paper, we first present a theoretical model in which lower and upper bounds on the number of observations needed for a defender to learn an attacker’s preferences is expressed. We then present empirical results in the form of simulated interactions between an attacker with fixed preferences and a learning defender. Lastly we discuss how these bounds can be used to inform an adaptive deceptive defense in which a defender can leverage their knowledge of attacker preferences to more optimally interfere with an attacker’s future actions.","2021","2025-07-17 05:09:03","2025-07-17 05:09:03","","138-157","","","","","","No Time to Lie","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bošanský, Branislav; Gonzalez, Cleotilde; Rass, Stefan; Sinha, Arunesh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although cybersecurity researchers have developed best practices to protect computer systems from hackers, it is not expected that ransomware attacks will be prohibited in a near future mainly due to their complexity and profitability. Despite the wide research studies for developing the proactive approaches to protect the systems from ransomware attacks, facilitating the negotiation between attacker and victim after a successful attack has not been well investigated yet. As the attacker does not know the victim’s true valuation for the data and the victim does not know the minimum ransom value that can satisfy the attacker, bargaining for ransom value can be time-consuming causing extra interruption cost for the victim. On the other hand, as there is no guarantee that the attacker will in turn release the decryption key after the payment of ransom, many victims are reluctant to pay the ransom and they accept the cost of data loss. Therefore, it is important to facilitate the negotiation between the attacker and victim to accelerate the release of data. To this end, first, we propose a mechanism to assist the negotiation for ransom value without a Trusted Third Party (TTP). We study the fair ransom value and investigate the development of a double-sided-blind auction mechanism to achieve the incentive-compatibility. In the second part, we propose a mechanism enforcing the victim and attacker to make the payment and release of decryption key without a TTP. To achieve this goal, we create a dynamic game and set incentives such that the subgame perfect equilibrium matches our design goal. We utilize smart-contract for the implementation of our proposed mechanisms to alleviate the TTP requirement.","2021","2025-07-17 05:09:03","2025-07-17 05:09:03","","181-194","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bošanský, Branislav; Gonzalez, Cleotilde; Rass, Stefan; Sinha, Arunesh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the game theoretic lens often frames the game as a competition between equals – a profit maximizing attacker and a loss minimizing defender – the reality of many situations is that ransomware organizations are not playing a non-cooperative game, they are playing a lottery. The wanton behavior of attackers creates a situation where many victims are hit more than once by ransomware operators, sometimes even by the same group. If defenders wish to combat malware, they must then seek to remove the incentives of it. In this work, we construct an expected value model based on data from actual ransomware attacks and identify three variables: the value of payments, the cost of an attack, and the probability of payment. Using this model, we consider the potential to manipulate these variables to reduce the profit motive associated with ransomware attack.

The agents then best-respond by manipulating their input features to obtain a desirable decision outcome so as to maximize their utilities. Earlier works in strategic machine learning assume that every agent’s strategic action is independent of others’. By contrast, we consider a different case where agents are connected in a network and can either benefit from their neighbors’ positive decision outcomes from the planner or benefit from their neighbors’ actions. We study the Stackelberg equilibrium in this new setting and highlight the similarities and differences between this model and the literature on network/graphical games and strategic machine learning.","2021","2025-07-17 05:09:03","2025-07-17 05:09:03","","118-137","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bošanský, Branislav; Gonzalez, Cleotilde; Rass, Stefan; Sinha, Arunesh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we study the controlled islanding problem of a power system under disturbances introduced by a malicious adversary. We formulate the interaction between the grid operator and adversary using a game-theoretic framework. The grid operator first computes a controlled islanding strategy, along with the power generation for the post-islanding system to guarantee stability. The adversary observes the strategies of the grid operator. The adversary then identifies critical substations of the power system to compromise and trips the transmission lines that are connected with compromised substations. For our game formulation, we propose a double oracle algorithm based approach that solves the best response for each player. We show that the best responses for the grid operator and adversary can be formulated as mixed integer linear programs. In addition, the best response of the adversary is equivalent to a submodular maximization problem under a cardinality constraint, which can be approximated up to a $$(1-\frac{1}{e})$$(1-1e)optimality bound in polynomial time. We compare the proposed approach with a baseline where the grid operator computes an islanding strategy by minimizing the power flow disruption without considering the possible response from the adversary. We evaluate both approaches using IEEE 9-bus, 14-bus, 30-bus, 39-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus power system case study data. Our proposed approach achieves better performance than the baseline in about $$44\%$$44%of test cases, and on average it incurs about 12.27 MW less power flow disruption.","2021","2025-07-17 05:09:03","2025-07-17 05:09:03","","231-250","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bošanský, Branislav; Gonzalez, Cleotilde; Rass, Stefan; Sinha, Arunesh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To model this situation, we propose a Bayesian game framework where the defender chooses a classifier with no a priori restriction on the set of possible classifiers. The key difficulty in the proposed framework is that the set of possible classifiers is exponential in the set of possible data, which is itself exponential in the number of features used for classification. To counter this, we first show that Bayesian Nash equilibria can be characterized completely via functional threshold classifiers with a small number of parameters. We then show that this low-dimensional characterization enables us to develop a training method to compute provably approximately optimal classifiers in a scalable manner; and to develop a learning algorithm for the online setting with low regret (both independent of the dimension of the set of possible data). We illustrate our results through simulations.","2021","2025-07-17 05:09:03","2025-07-17 05:09:03","","80-97","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bošanský, Branislav; Gonzalez, Cleotilde; Rass, Stefan; Sinha, Arunesh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These methods typically use networks that output the parameters of a diagonal Gaussian distribution from which the resulting action is sampled. In multi-agent contexts, however, better policies may require complex multimodal action distributions. Based on recent progress in density modeling, we propose an alternative for policy representation in the form of conditional normalizing flows.

Advanced encryption techniques are intended to mitigate network information exposure, but they remain vulnerable to statistical analysis of traffic features. An adversary can classify different applications and protocols from the observable statistical properties, especially from the meta-data (e.g. packet size, timing, flow directions, etc.). Several approaches are already being developed to protect computer network infrastructure from attacks using traffic analysis, but none of them are fully effective. We investigate solutions based on obfuscating the patterns in network traffic to make it more difficult to accurately use classification to extract information such as protocols or applications in use. A key problem of using obfuscation methods is to determine an appropriate algorithm that introduces minimal changes but preserves the functionality of the protocol. We apply Adversarial Machine Learning techniques to find realistic small perturbations that can improve the security and privacy of a network against traffic analysis. We introduce a novel approach for generating adversarial examples that obtains state-of-the-art performance compared to previous approaches, while considering more realistic constraints on perturbations.","2020","2025-07-17 05:09:17","2025-07-17 05:09:17","","45-57","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Zhu, Quanyan; Baras, John S.; Poovendran, Radha; Chen, Juntao","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We rely on short-time observations of the trajectories of the UAVs and develop a leader detection scheme based on the notion of Granger causality. We proceed with the estimation of the swarm’s coordination laws, modeled by a generalized Cucker-Smale model with non-local repulsive potential functions and dynamically changing leaders, through an appropriately defined iterative optimization algorithm. Similar problems exist in communication and computer networks, as well as social networks over the Internet. Thus, the methodology and algorithms proposed can be applied to many types of network swarms including detection of influential malevolent “sources” of attacks and “miss-information”.

To maximize the impact of MTD, a defender must strategically choose when and what changes to make, taking into account both the characteristics of its system as well as the adversary’s observed activities. Finding an optimal strategy for MTD presents a significant challenge, especially when facing a resourceful and determined adversary who may respond to the defender’s actions. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent partially-observable Markov Decision Process model of MTD and formulate a two-player general-sum game between the adversary and the defender. To solve this game, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework based on the double oracle algorithm.

Such approaches can provide advantages to defenders by delaying attacker forward progress and thereby decreasing or eliminating attacker payoffs. In this work, we expand previous work by incorporating new parameters relating to attacker costs and choices. The extended model includes attacker costs for probing a system to learn its declared type (“real” or “fake”) and allows an attacker to proactively choose to leave the game early by walking away. While these additional parameters represent extensions to our prior model, they are key to understanding attacker behavior when confronted with deceptive cyber defenses. We first present the extended model and an analysis of the expected rewards for rational players. We then present the behavior of an adaptive attacker in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) simulation. Lastly, we relate our analytic and empirical findings to cognitive bias effects and speculate on how the manipulation of game parameters may be used in future work to both estimate and trigger bias effects during defender-attacker interactions.","2020","2025-07-17 05:09:17","2025-07-17 05:09:17","","80-100","","","","","","Lie Another Day","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Zhu, Quanyan; Baras, John S.; Poovendran, Radha; Chen, Juntao","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently proposed models to optimize a deceptive defense based on camouflaging network and system attributes, have shown effective numerical results on simulated data. However, these models possess a fundamental drawback due to the assumption that an attempted attack is always successful—as a direct consequence of the deceptive strategies being deployed, the attacker runs a significant risk that the attack fails. Further, this risk or uncertainty in the rewards magnifies the boundedly rational behavior in humans which the previous models do not handle. To that end, we present Risk-based Cyber Camouflage Games—a general-sum game model that captures the uncertainty in the attack’s success. In case of the rational attackers, we show that optimal defender strategy computation is NP-hard even in the zero-sum case. We provide an MILP formulation for the general problem with constraints on cost and feasibility, along with a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for the special unconstrained setting. Second, for risk-averse attackers, we present a solution based on Prospect theoretic modeling along with a robust variant that minimizes regret. Third, we propose a solution that does not rely on the attacker behavior model or past data, and effective for the broad setting of strictly competitive games where previous solutions against bounded rationality prove ineffective.

We investigate the problem of limiting the diffusion of negative information by blocking nodes and edges in the network. We formulate the interaction between the defender and the attacker as a Stackelberg game where the defender first chooses a set of nodes to block and then the attacker selects a set of seeds to spread negative information from. This yields an extremely complex bi-level optimization problem, particularly since even the standard influence measures are difficult to compute. Our approach is to approximate the attacker’s problem as the maximum node domination problem. To solve this problem, we first develop a method based on integer programming combined with constraint generation. Next, to improve scalability, we develop an approximate solution method that represents the attacker’s problem as an integer program, and then combines relaxation with duality to yield an upper bound on the defender’s objective that can be computed using mixed integer linear programming. Finally, we propose an even more scalable heuristic method that prunes nodes from the consideration set based on their degree.

Using a novel combination of generative adversarial network (GAN) elements, participating cognitive radio devices learn a representation of local network activity data through a non-cooperative (strategic) game.

Due to the stealthy and persistent nature of the lateral movement, defenders need to consider time and spatial locations holistically to discover latent attack paths across a large time-scale and achieve long-term security for the target assets. In this work, we propose a time-expanded random network to model the stochastic service links in the user-host enterprise network and the adversarial lateral movement. We design cognitive honeypots at idle production nodes and disguise honey links as service links to detect and deter the adversarial lateral movement. The location of the honeypot changes randomly at different times and increases the honeypots’ stealthiness. Since the defender does not know whether, when, and where the initial intrusion and the lateral movement occur, the honeypot policy aims to reduce the target assets’ Long-Term Vulnerability (LTV) for proactive and persistent protection. We further characterize three tradeoffs, i.e., the probability of interference, the stealthiness level, and the roaming cost. To counter the curse of multiple attack paths, we propose an iterative algorithm and approximate the LTV with the union bound for computationally efficient deployment of cognitive honeypots. The results of the vulnerability analysis illustrate the bounds, trends, and a residue of LTV when the adversarial lateral movement has infinite duration. Besides honeypot policies, we obtain a critical threshold of compromisability to guide the design and modification of the current system parameters for a higher level of long-term security. We show that the target node can achieve zero vulnerability under infinite stages of lateral movement if the probability of movement deterrence is not less than the threshold.","2020","2025-07-17 05:09:17","2025-07-17 05:09:17","","125-146","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Zhu, Quanyan; Baras, John S.; Poovendran, Radha; Chen, Juntao","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, we focus on the problem of jointly synthesizing a decoy placement strategy and a deceptive defense strategy that maximally exploits the incomplete information the attacker about the decoy locations. We introduce a model of hypergames on graphs with temporal logic objectives to capture such adversarial interactions with asymmetric information. Using the hypergame model, we analyze the effectiveness of a given decoy placement, quantified by the set of deceptive winning states where the defender can prevent the attacker from satisfying the attack objective given its incomplete information about decoy locations. Then, we investigate how to place decoys to maximize the defender’s deceptive winning region. Considering the large search space for all possible decoy allocation strategies, we incorporate the idea of compositional synthesis from formal methods and show that the objective function in the class of decoy allocation problem is monotone and non-decreasing. We derive the sufficient conditions under which the objective function for the decoy allocation problem is submodular, or supermodular, respectively. We show a sub-optimal allocation can be efficiently computed by iteratively composing the solutions of hypergames with a subset of decoys and the solution of a hypergame given a single decoy. We use a running example to illustrate the proposed method.","2020","2025-07-17 05:09:17","2025-07-17 05:09:17","","168-187","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Zhu, Quanyan; Baras, John S.; Poovendran, Radha; Chen, Juntao","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, regularly monitoring the behavior of such components is of utmost importance. Furthermore, the recent increase in the number of cyberattacks on such systems demands that such monitoring strategies should be robust. In this paper, we draw inspiration from work in Moving Target Defense (MTD) and consider a dynamic monitoring strategy that makes it difficult for an attacker to prevent unique identification of behavioral signals that indicate the status of HVTs. We first formulate the problem of finding a differentially immune configuration set for an MTD in the context of power grids and then propose algorithms to compute it. To find the optimal movement strategy, we model the MTD as a two-player game and consider the Stackelberg strategy. With the help of IEEE test cases, we show the efficacy and scalability of our proposed approaches.","2020","2025-07-17 05:09:17","2025-07-17 05:09:17","","241-253","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Zhu, Quanyan; Baras, John S.; Poovendran, Radha; Chen, Juntao","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The agents are linear stochastic control systems having a communication channel between the sensor and the controller for each agent. The strategic interaction is modeled as a Secure Linear-Quadratic Mean-Field Game (SLQ-MFG), within a consensus framework, where the communication channel is noiseless, but, is susceptible to eavesdropping by adversaries. For the purposes of security, the sensor shares only a sketch of the states using a private key. The controller for each agent has the knowledge of the private key, and has fast access to the sketches of states from the sensor. We propose a secure communication mechanism between the sensor and controller, and a state reconstruction procedure using multi-rate sensor output sampling at the controller. We establish that the state reconstruction is noisy, and hence the Mean-Field Equilibrium (MFE) of the SLQ-MFG does not exist in the class of linear controllers. We introduce the notion of an approximate MFE ($$\epsilon $$ϵ-MFE) and prove that the MFE of the standard (non-secure) LQ-MFG is an $$\epsilon $$ϵ-MFE of the SLQ-MFG. Also, we show that $$\epsilon \rightarrow 0$$ϵ→0as the estimation error in state reconstruction approaches 0. Furthermore, we show that the MFE of LQ-MFG is also an $$(\epsilon +\varepsilon )$$(ϵ+ε)-Nash equilibrium for the finite population version of the SLQ-MFG; and $$(\epsilon +\varepsilon ) \rightarrow 0$$(ϵ+ε)→0as the estimation error approaches 0 and the number of agents $$n \rightarrow \infty $$n→∞.

Owing to realistic demands for an early product launch, oftentimes there are vulnerabilities that are present in these deployed systems (or eventually found out). The cloud service provider can find and leverage this knowledge about known vulnerabilities and the underlying communication network topology of the system to position network and host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that can effectively detect attacks. Unfortunately, deploying IDS on each host and network interface impacts the performance of the overall system. Thus, in this paper, we address the problem of placing a limited number of IDS by using the concept of Moving Target Defense (MTD). In essence, we propose an MTD system that allows a defender to shift the detection surfaces and strategically switch among the different IDS placement configurations in each round. To find a secure switching strategy, we (1) formulate the problem of placing a limited number of IDS systems in a large cloud network as a Stackelberg Game between the cloud administrator and an (external or stealthy) attacker, (2) design scalable methods to find the optimal strategies for switching IDS placements at the start of each round, and (3) formally define the problem of identifying the most critical vulnerability that should be fixed, and propose a solution for it. We compare the strategy generated by our method to other state-of-the-art strategies, showcasing the effectiveness and scalability of our method for real-world scenarios.","2018","2025-07-17 05:09:38","2025-07-17 05:09:38","","326-345","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bushnell, Linda; Poovendran, Radha; Başar, Tamer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the example of loss minimization, an undercut of the expected loss is unproblematic, while suffering more than the expected loss may disappoint the player and lead it to believe that the played strategy is not optimal. In the worst case, this may subsequently cause deviations towards seemingly better strategies, even though the equilibrium cannot be improved in general. Such deviations from the utility maximization principle are subject of bounded rationality research, and this work is a step towards more accurate game theoretic models that include disappointment aversion as an additional incentive. This incentive necessarily creates discontinuities in the payoff functionals, so that Nash’s classical equilibrium theorem is no longer applicable. For games with disappointment aversion (defined in this work) the existence of equilibria can nonetheless be shown, i.e., we are able to find Nash equilibria that comply with disappointment aversion.","2018","2025-07-17 05:09:38","2025-07-17 05:09:38","","314-325","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bushnell, Linda; Poovendran, Radha; Başar, Tamer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the first stage of the game, the defenders can choose to form independent coalitions by transferring resources (troops, funds, computing resources, etc.) among each other if the transfer benefits the defenders involved. In the second stage, the attacker observes these transfers among defenders and then allocates a portion of his overall resources to fight against each defender. We find that the formation of coalitions depends on both the ratios of resources between the attacker and the defenders and on each defender’s total battlefield value to resource ratio. For one parameter region, we completely characterize the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium. For another parameter region, we show that there are parameters of the game for which transfers occur and provide a computational method to calculate those transfers.","2018","2025-07-17 05:09:38","2025-07-17 05:09:38","","166-185","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bushnell, Linda; Poovendran, Radha; Başar, Tamer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The multi-stage Bayesian game captures the incomplete information of the players’ type, and enables an adaptive belief update according to the observable history of the other player’s actions. The solution concept of perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium (PBNE) under the proactive and reactive information structures of the players provides an important analytical tool to predict and design the players’ behavior. To capture the learning process and enable fast computation of PBNE, we use conjugate priors to update the beliefs of the players parametrically, which is assimilated into backward dynamic programming with an expanded state space. We use a mathematical programming approach to compute the PBNE of the dynamic bi-matrix game of incomplete information. In the case study, we analyze and study two PBNEs under complete and one-sided incomplete information. The results reveal the benefit of deception of the private attackers’ types and motivate defender’s use of deception techniques to tilt the information asymmetry. Numerical results have been used to corroborate the analytical findings of our framework and show the effectiveness of defense design to deter the attackers and mitigate the APTs strategically.","2018","2025-07-17 05:09:38","2025-07-17 05:09:38","","205-226","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bushnell, Linda; Poovendran, Radha; Başar, Tamer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This begs understanding of the following question: can the marketplace sustain multiple SPs that offer privacy differentiated free services? This paper studies the impact of privacy on free online service markets by augmenting the classical Hotelling model for market segmentation analysis. A parametrized game-theoretic model is proposed which captures: (i) the fact that for the free service market, consumers value service not in monetized terms but by the quality of service (QoS); (ii) the differentiator of services is not product price but the privacy risk advertised by an SP; and (iii) consumer’s heterogeneous privacy preference for SPs. For the two-SP problem with uniformly distributed consumer privacy preference and linear SP profit function, the results suggest that: (i) when consumers place a higher value on privacy, it leads to a larger market share for the SP providing untargeted services and a “softened” competition between SPs; (ii) SPs offering high privacy risk services are sustainable only if they offer sufficiently high QoS; and (iii) SPs that are capable of differentiating on services that do not directly use consumer data gain larger market share. Similar results are observed when the consumer’s privacy preference is modeled as a truncated Gaussian distribution.","2018","2025-07-17 05:09:38","2025-07-17 05:09:38","","1-21","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bushnell, Linda; Poovendran, Radha; Başar, Tamer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To secure VANETs, they are often designed with authenticated communications that allows for verification of the sender. In order to enable authenticated communications without sacrificing user privacy VANET designers often employ pseudonyms, temporary identifiers that are tied to a single user. In order to maximize location privacy, vehicles must temporally coordinate pseudonym changes using a mix-zone strategy. However, to be effective mix-zones either require vehicles to cooperate or have greedy motivation. Previously, game-theoretic analysis of greedy nodes have developed equilibrium strategies. However, this work did not consider malicious Byzantine attackers who only desire to minimize system-wide location privacy. In this work, we design two Byzantine attackers that target location privacy in VANETs. The first, which we call a naïve attacker, never cooperates. The second, which we call a stealthy attacker, attempts to minimize system wide location privacy while not being detected. We simulate both of these attackers and show that an attacker can reduce location privacy in a mix-zone by up to 12%.","2018","2025-07-17 05:09:38","2025-07-17 05:09:38","","277-295","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bushnell, Linda; Poovendran, Radha; Başar, Tamer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is assumed that an adversary corrupts a subset of the channels, and makes eavesdropping and tampering over the corrupted channels. In this work, we consider a game-theoretic security model for SMT. Specifically, we introduce a rational adversary who has the preference for the outcome of the protocol execution. We show that, under some reasonable assumption on the adversary’s preference, even if the adversary corrupts all but one of the channels, it is possible to construct SMT protocols with perfect security against rational adversaries. More specifically, we consider “timid” adversaries who prefer to violate the security requirement of SMT, but do not prefer the tampering actions to be detected. In the traditional cryptographic setting, perfect SMT can be constructed only when the adversary corrupt a minority of the channels. Our results demonstrate a way of circumventing the impossibility results of cryptographic protocols based on a game-theoretic approach.","2018","2025-07-17 05:09:38","2025-07-17 05:09:38","","127-144","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bushnell, Linda; Poovendran, Radha; Başar, Tamer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, the need to believe that players will behave consistently exposes the network to vulnerabilities associated with cyber-physical attacks. This paper investigates the effects of cyber-physical attacks on the outcome of distributed aggregative games (DAGs). More specifically, we are seeking to answer two main questions: (1) how a stealthy attack can deviate the game outcome from a cooperative Nash equilibrium, and by doing so, (2) by how much efficiency of a DAG degrades. To this end, we first show that adversaries can stealthily manipulate the outcome of a DAG by compromising the Nash equilibrium solution and consequently lead to an emergent misbehavior or no emergent behavior. This study will intensify the urgency of designing novel resilient solutions to DAGs so that the overall network sustains some notion of acceptable global behavior in the presence of malicious agents. Finally, we corroborate and illustrate our results by providing simulation examples. Simulations reveal that the adverse effect of a compromised agent is considerably worse than that of a selfish agent.","2018","2025-07-17 05:09:38","2025-07-17 05:09:38","","296-313","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bushnell, Linda; Poovendran, Radha; Başar, Tamer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evaluating performance is complicated by the stochastic nature of losses. It is recognised that this information asymmetry may lead to a “market for lemons” in which suppliers face no incentive to provide higher quality products. Some security vendors have begun to offer cyber-warranties—voluntary ex-ante obligations to indemnify the customer in the event of a cyber attack—to function as a quality signal. Much like how consumer protection laws are relatively more costly to firms offering low quality products, cyber-warranties are more costly for firms developing low quality enterprise security products. In this paper, we introduce a decision-theoretic model to explore how consumers might use cyber-warranties to increase information when purchasing security products. Our analysis derives four inferences that consumers can make about a security product. We discuss the difficulties customers might face in using these inferences to make real world decisions.","2018","2025-07-17 05:09:38","2025-07-17 05:09:38","","22-37","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bushnell, Linda; Poovendran, Radha; Başar, Tamer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior defenses attempted to make deep networks more robust by either changing the network architecture or augmenting the training set with adversarial examples, but both have inherent limitations. Motivated by recent research that shows outliers in the training set have a high negative influence on the trained model, we studied the relationship between model robustness and the quality of the training set. We first show that outliers give the model better generalization ability but weaker robustness. Next, we propose an adversarial example detection framework, in which we design two methods for removing outliers from training set to obtain the sanitized model and then detect adversarial example by calculating the difference of outputs between the original and the sanitized model. We evaluated the framework on both MNIST and SVHN. Based on the difference measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence, we could detect adversarial examples with accuracy between 94.67% to 99.89%.","2018","2025-07-17 05:09:38","2025-07-17 05:09:38","","102-114","","","","","","Less is More","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bushnell, Linda; Poovendran, Radha; Başar, Tamer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, sending either the training set or the trained model to Bob can raise suspicion if the communication is monitored. Training set camouflage allows Alice to compute a second training set on a completely different – and seemingly benign – classification task. By construction, sending the second training set will not raise suspicion. When Bob applies his standard (public) learning algorithm to the second training set, he approximately recovers the classifier on the original task. Training set camouflage is a novel form of steganography in machine learning. We formulate training set camouflage as a combinatorial bilevel optimization problem and propose solvers based on nonlinear programming and local search.

While a variety of factors have been shown to attract the followers, very little work has been done to analyze the mechanism how Twitter users follow or unfollow each other. In this paper, we apply game theory to modeling the follow-unfollow mechanism on Twitter. We first present a two-player game which is based on the Prisoner’s Dilemma, and subsequently evaluate the payoffs when the two players adopt different strategies. To allow two players to play multiple rounds of the game, we propose a multi-stage game model. We design a Twitter bot analyzer which follows or unfollows other Twitter users by adopting the strategies from the multi-stage game. We develop an algorithm which enables the Twitter bot analyzer to automatically collect and analyze the data. The results from analyzing the data collected in our experiment show that the follow-back ratios for both of the Twitter bots are very low, which are $$0.76\%$$and $$0.86\%$$. This means that most of the Twitter users do not cooperate and only want to be followed instead of following others. Our results also exhibit the effect of different strategies on the follow-back followers and on the non-following followers as well.","2018","2025-07-17 05:09:38","2025-07-17 05:09:38","","265-276","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bushnell, Linda; Poovendran, Radha; Başar, Tamer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

QKD protocols allow two parties to agree on a shared secret key, secure against an adversary bounded only by the laws of physics (as opposed to classical key distribution protocols which, by necessity, require computational assumptions to be placed on the power of an adversary). We investigate a novel framework of security using game theory where all participants (including the adversary) are rational. We will show that, in this framework, certain impossibility results for QKD in the standard adversarial model of security still remain true here.

In each stage of the attack, the adversary gathers more privileges, resources, and information about the system and uses this information to gain access to the targeted data of the next stage to reach the final goal. APTs are not only persistent but also stealthy and hence difficult to detect. The persistent nature of APTs, however, creates information flows in the system that can be monitored. One monitoring mechanism is Dynamic Information Flow Tracking (DIFT), which taints and tracks malicious information flows through a system and inspects the flows at designated traps. Since tainting all flows in the system will incur prohibitive resource costs, efficient tagging policies are needed to decide which flows to tag in order to maximize the probability of APT detection while minimizing resource overhead. At present such an analytical model for DIFT for multi-stage APT detection does not exist. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic framework modeling real-time detection of multi-stage APTs via DIFT. We formulate a two-player (APT vs DIFT) nonzero-sum stochastic game with incomplete information to obtain an optimal tagging policy. Our game model consists of a sequence of stages, where each stage of the game corresponds to a stage in the attack. At each stage, the goal of the APT is to reach a particular destination, corresponding to a targeted resource or privilege, while the goal of the defender is to detect the APT. We first derive an efficient algorithm to find locally optimal strategies for both players. We then characterize the best responses of both players and present algorithms to find the best responses. Finally, we validate our results on a real-world attack data set obtained using the Refinable Attack INvestigation (RAIN) framework for a ScreenGrab attack.","2018","2025-07-17 05:09:38","2025-07-17 05:09:38","","80-101","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Bushnell, Linda; Poovendran, Radha; Başar, Tamer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike Feldman and Gonen (2018), our model is dynamic and involves multi-sided markets where all participating sides are strategic. We describe a mechanism for this model which is theoretically guaranteed to (approximately) maximize the gain from trade, avoid a budget deficit and incentivize truthfulness and voluntary participation.

In face of unknown incentives of employees, a reasonable audit strategy for the organization is one that minimizes its regret. While regret minimization has been extensively studied in repeated games, the standard notion of regret for repeated games cannot capture the complexity of the interaction between the organization (defender) and an adversary, which arises from dependence of rewards and actions on history. To account for this generality, we introduce a richer class of games called bounded-memory games, which can provide a more accurate model of the audit process. We introduce the notion of k-adaptive regret, which compares the reward obtained by playing actions prescribed by the algorithm against a hypothetical k-adaptive adversary with the reward obtained by the best expert in hindsight against the same adversary. Roughly, a hypothetical k-adaptive adversary adapts her strategy to the defender’s actions exactly as the real adversary would within each window of k rounds. A k-adaptive adversary is a natural model for temporary adversaries (e.g., company employees) who stay for a certain number of audit cycles and are then replaced by a different person. Our definition is parameterized by a set of experts, which can include both fixed and adaptive defender strategies. We investigate the inherent complexity of and design algorithms for adaptive regret minimization in bounded-memory games of perfect and imperfect information. We prove a hardness result showing that, with imperfect information, any k-adaptive regret minimizing algorithm (with fixed strategies as experts) must be inefficient unless NP = RP even when playing against an oblivious adversary. In contrast, for bounded-memory games of perfect and imperfect information we present approximate 0-adaptive regret minimization algorithms against an oblivious adversary running in time $n^{O\left(1\right)}$.","2013","2025-07-17 05:10:33","2025-07-17 05:10:33","","65-84","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\ABZT5ZTE\Blocki et al. - 2013 - Adaptive Regret Minimization in Bounded-Memory Games.pdf","","","","Das, Sajal K.; Nita-Rotaru, Cristina; Kantarcioglu, Murat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper concentrates on the co-resident attack, where malicious users aim to co-locate their virtual machines (VMs) with target VMs on the same physical server, and then exploit side channels to extract private information from the victim.Most of the previous work has discussed how to eliminate or mitigate the threat of side channels. However, the presented solutions are impractical for the current commercial cloud platforms. We approach the problem from a different perspective, and study how to minimise the attacker’s possibility of co-locating their VMs with the targets, while maintaining a satisfactory workload balance and low power consumption for the system. Specifically, we introduce a security game model to compare different VM allocation policies. Our analysis shows that rather than deploying one single policy, the cloud provider decreases the attacker’s possibility of achieving co-location by having a policy pool, where each policy is selected with a certain probability. Our solution does not require any changes to the underlying infrastructure. Hence, it can be easily implemented in existing cloud computing platforms.","2013","2025-07-17 05:10:33","2025-07-17 05:10:33","","99-118","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Das, Sajal K.; Nita-Rotaru, Cristina; Kantarcioglu, Murat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A TRG algorithm generally consists of (i) an entropy source and (ii) an extractor algorithm that uses a random seed to extract the randomness of the entropy source. We propose a TRG that uses the user input in a game played between the user and the computer both as the output of an entropy source, and the random seed required for the extractor. An important property of this TRG is that the (randomness) quality of its output can be flexibly adjusted. We describe the theoretical foundation of the approach and design and implement a game that instantiates the approach. We give the results of our experiments with users playing the game, and analysis of the resulting output strings.

Because the attacks are covert, the defender must choose to secure the resource in real time without knowing who controls it. Each move by the defender to secure the resource has a one-time cost and these defending moves are not covert, so that a targeted attacker may time her attacks based on the defender’s moves. The time between when a targeted attack starts and when it succeeds is given by an exponentially distributed random variable with a known rate. Non-targeted attackers are modeled together as a single attacker whose attacks arrive following a Poisson process. We find that in this regime, the optimal moving strategy for the defender is a periodic strategy, so that the time intervals between consecutive moves are constant.","2013","2025-07-17 05:10:33","2025-07-17 05:10:33","","175-191","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Das, Sajal K.; Nita-Rotaru, Cristina; Kantarcioglu, Murat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The employment of secure perimeter firewalls and intrusion detection systems cannot fully protect the network from sophisticated attacks. As an alternative to the expensive and imperfect detection of attacks, it is possible to improve network security by manipulating the attack surface of the network in order to create a moving target defense. In this paper, we introduce a proactive defense scheme that dynamically alters the attack surface of the network to make it difficult for attackers to gather system information by increasing complexity and reducing its signatures. We use concepts from systems and control literature to design an optimal and efficient multi-stage defense mechanism based on a feedback information structure. The change of attack surface involves a reconfiguration cost and a utility gain resulting from risk reduction. We use information- and control-theoretic tools to provide closed-form optimal randomization strategies. The results are corroborated by a case study and several numerical examples.","2013","2025-07-17 05:10:33","2025-07-17 05:10:33","","246-263","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Das, Sajal K.; Nita-Rotaru, Cristina; Kantarcioglu, Murat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, the perfect Bayesian equilibrium concept is able to address dynamic games, where players move sequentially rather than simultaneously. By considering players that move sequentially, we are able to remove the assumption of a broadcast channel.

Most existing approaches for computing defender strategies against boundedly rational adversaries try to optimize against specific behavioral models of adversaries, and provide no quality guarantee when the estimated model is inaccurate. We propose a new solution concept, monotonic maximin, which provides guarantees against all adversary behavior models satisfying monotonicity, including all in the family of Regular Quantal Response functions. We propose a mixed-integer linear program formulation for computing monotonic maximin.

Automated inference engines that fuse the answers or opinions from the crowd to make critical decisions are susceptible to unreliable, low-skilled and malicious workers who tend to mislead the system towards inaccurate inferences. We present a probabilistic generative framework to model worker responses for multicategory crowdsourcing tasks based on two novel paradigms. First, we decompose worker reliability into skill level and intention. Second, we introduce a stochastic model for answer generation that plausibly captures the interplay between worker skills, intentions, and task difficulties. This framework allows us to model and estimate a broad range of worker “types”. A generalized Expectation Maximization algorithm is presented to jointly estimate the unknown ground truth answers along with worker and task parameters. As supported experimentally, the proposed scheme de-emphasizes answers from low skilled workers and leverages malicious workers to, in fact, improve crowd aggregation. Moreover, our approach is especially advantageous when there is an (a priori unknown) majority of low-skilled and/or malicious workers in the crowd.","2013","2025-07-17 05:10:33","2025-07-17 05:10:33","","140-153","","","","","","Defeating Tyranny of the Masses in Crowdsourcing","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Das, Sajal K.; Nita-Rotaru, Cristina; Kantarcioglu, Murat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our model involves one single Gaussian source observed by many sensors, subject to additive independent Gaussian observation noise. Sensors communicate with the receiver over an additive Gaussian multiple access channel. The aim of the receiver is to reconstruct the underlying source with minimum mean squared error. The scenario of interest here is one where some of the sensors act as adversary (jammer): they aim to maximize distortion. While our recent prior work solved the case where either all or none of the sensors coordinate (use randomized strategies), the focus of this work is the setting where only a subset of the transmitter and/or jammer sensors can coordinate. We show that the solution crucially depends on the ratio of the number of transmitter sensors that can coordinate to the ones that cannot. If this ratio is larger than a fixed threshold determined by the network settings (transmit and jamming power, channel noise and sensor observation noise), then the problem is a zero-sum game and admits a saddle point solution where transmitters with coordination capabilities use randomized linear encoding while the rest of the transmitter sensors is not used at all. Adversarial sensors that can coordinate generate identical Gaussian noise while other adversaries generate independent Gaussian noise. Otherwise (if that ratio is smaller than the threshold), the problem becomes a Stackelberg game where the leader (all transmitter sensors) uses fixed (non-randomized) linear encoding while the follower (all adversarial sensors) uses fixed linear encoding with the opposite sign.","2013","2025-07-17 05:10:33","2025-07-17 05:10:33","","1-9","","","","","","On Communication over Gaussian Sensor Networks with Adversaries","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Das, Sajal K.; Nita-Rotaru, Cristina; Kantarcioglu, Murat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The inclusive nature of such projects poses difficult challenges for ensuring trustworthiness and combating vandalism. Prior studies in the area deal with descriptive aspects of peer production, failing to capture the idea that while contributors collaborate, they also compete for status in the community and for imposing their views on the product. In this paper, we investigate collaborative authoring in Wikipedia, where contributors append and overwrite previous contributions to a page. We assume that a contributor’s goal is to maximize ownership of content sections, such that content owned (i.e. originated) by her survived the most recent revision of the page. We model contributors’ interactions to increase their content ownership as a non-cooperative game, where a player’s utility is associated with content owned and cost is a function of effort expended. Our results capture several real-life aspects of contributors interactions within peer-production projects. Namely, we show that at the Nash equilibrium there is an inverse relationship between the effort required to make a contribution and the survival of a contributor’s content. In other words, majority of the content that survives is necessarily contributed by experts who expend relatively less effort than non-experts. An empirical analysis of Wikipedia articles provides support for our model’s predictions. Implications for research and practice are discussed in the context of trustworthy collaboration as well as vandalism.","2013","2025-07-17 05:10:33","2025-07-17 05:10:33","","29-44","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Das, Sajal K.; Nita-Rotaru, Cristina; Kantarcioglu, Murat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, such a strategy involves negotiations with other nations concerning the use of their defence systems as part of the layered defence system. This paper introduces the Cooperative Ballistic Missile Defense Game, $\mathcal{CBMDG}$, to support the strategic negotiations between a threatened nation and the possible coalition nations. The model determines the assignment of ballistic missile interceptors to the coalition nations that minimizes the expected number of interceptors required to achieve the desired defence level in case of an attack. Simultaneously, it identifies the bargaining strength of each coalition of nations, in order to determine the compensation for participating in the layered defence system to protect the threatened nation.","2013","2025-07-17 05:10:33","2025-07-17 05:10:33","","85-98","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Das, Sajal K.; Nita-Rotaru, Cristina; Kantarcioglu, Murat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Efficient preparation through cybersecurity games has become an invaluable tool to better prepare strategy and response to cyber incidents. Such games offer the potential for capacity building of decision-makers through a controlled environment, often presenting hypothetical scenarios that are designed to invoke discussion, while decision-making skills are put to the test. While games are acknowledged to be an effective method for such situations, many rely on technical capabilities to address these challenges. However, a key challenge is to understand the factors that influence cybersecurity decision-making. Further, game effectiveness for developing these skills is often not validated. This paper surveys cybersecurity games and compiles a data-set of 46 games to investigate how effective cybersecurity games are for assessing decision-making skills, and determines the state-of-the-art game. Through critical review and analysis of the data-set, a criteria to assess games for decision-making skills is presented. Furthermore, the criteria is applied to ten games, which determined Cyber 9/12 to be the state-of-the-art cybersecurity game for decision-making. The paper concludes with insights into how the assessment criteria can support the development of better decision-making skills through games.","2020","2025-07-17 05:11:22","2025-07-17 05:11:22","","411-423","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\PQQKHWDC\Hussain et al. - 2020 - Games for Cybersecurity Decision-Making.pdf","","","Capacity-building; Cybersecurity games; Decision-making; Human-computer interaction","Fang, Xiaowen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The focus is on validating the proposed strategic game model through a case study. The case study involves a scenario where defenders select strategies such as “monitor system,” “detecting system,” and “respond to attack,” while attackers choose various attack strategies like “monitoring attack,” “scan the organization's website,” and “develop malicious payloads” within the stages of the CKC.

Ideally, risk management involves processes that engage the entire organization continually and holistically—not just episodic reactions by a few key personnel in times of crisis. The translation of lessons learned into implemented and validated improvements may be a missing or underutilized best practice. This chapter explores ways gaming can be used as a complement to authoritative standards and frameworks to optimize an organization’s cybersecurity posture and preparedness. A variety of gamified approaches are described and presented as useful tools with differentiating value at multiple stages in an ongoing cybersecurity risk management cycle. State-of-the-practice exemplars and successes are cited as are approaches to adapting games to both assess and improve an organization’s cybersecurity posture.

This requires models that are an accurate reflection of reality. This paper presents a biased bird’s-eye view of the security-related GT research of the past decade.

Preparing a game require several steps, including the definition of attack and defense strategies, estimation of payoffs, etc. Specifically, during the preparation of a game, the estimation of payoffs (i.e. damage) for each possible scenario is one of its core tasks. However, damage estimation is not always a trivial task since it cannot be easily predicted, primarily due to incomplete information about the attack or due to external influences (e.g. weather conditions, etc.). Therefore, it is evident that describing the payoffs by means of a probability distribution may be an appropriate approach to deal with this uncertainty. In this chapter, we show that if the network structure of an organization is known, it is possible to estimate the payoff distribution by means of a stochastic spreading model. To this extend, the underlying network is modeled as a graph whose edges are classified depending on their properties. Each of these classes has a different probability of failure (e.g. probability of transmitting a malware). Finally, we demonstrate how these probabilities can be estimated, even if only subjective information is available.","2018","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:37","185-201","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-75268-6_8","","","","","","Rass, Stefan; Schauer, Stefan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Commonly, decision options are rated based on their expected utility. This approach is intuitive and successful in many cases, but has difficulties when the utility to be associated with an action is unknown or at least uncertain. Both problems can be addressed by accepting randomness as an intrinsic part of the utility itself, leading to defining optimal decisions in terms of stochastic orders rather than upon benchmark figures (only). For one such (even total) stochastic order, we give a complete construction, accompanied by examples and procedures how to get a (stochastically optimal) decision. A discussion of how game theory can be put on top of the stochastic order, as well as how the ordering can be applied to general IT risk management closes the chapter.","2018","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:37","21-46","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-75268-6_2","","","","","","Rass, Stefan; Schauer, Stefan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interdependencies between the assets play a critical role in the security of the overall system, especially against strategic attackers who exploit these interdependencies to target valuable assets. In this work, we develop a general game-theoretic framework to model the security investments of resource-constrained stakeholders against targeted attacks. We consider two complementary problems: (i) where defenders are given a budget to minimize expected loss due to attacks and (ii) where defenders minimize security investment cost subject to a maximum security risk they are willing to tolerate per each valuable asset. For both problems, we establish the existence of Nash equilibria and show that the problem of computing the optimal defense allocation by a central authority and the (decentralized) problem of computing the best response for a single defender can be formulated as convex optimization problems. We then show that our framework can be applied to determine deployment of moving target defense (MTD) in networks. We first apply the game-theoretic framework on the IEEE 300 bus power grid network and compare the optimal expected loss (respectively, security investment cost) under centralized and Nash equilibrium defense allocations. We then show how our framework can be used to compute optimal deployment of MTD on an e-commerce system.","2018","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:37","157-184","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-75268-6_7","","","","","","Rass, Stefan; Schauer, Stefan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, the estimation of potential threats and security issues as well as a proper assessment of the respective risks is a core duty of utility providers. Despite the fact that utility providers operate several networks (e.g., communication, control, and utility networks), most of today’s risk management tools only focus on one of these networks. In this chpater, we will give an overview of a novel risk management process specifically designed for estimating threats and assessing risks in highly interconnected networks. Based on the internationally accepted standard for risk management, ISO 31000, our risk management process integrates various methodologies and tools supporting the different steps of the process from risk identification up to risk treatment. At the heart of this process, a novel game-theoretic approach for risk minimization and risk treatment is applied. This approach is specifically designed to take the information coming from the various tools into account and model the complex interplay between the heterogeneous networks, systems, and operators within a utility provider. It operates on qualitative and semiquantitative information as well as empirical data and uses distribution-valued payoffs to account for the unpredictable effects occurring in this highly uncertain environment.","2018","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:37","285-311","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-75268-6_12","","","","","","Rass, Stefan; Schauer, Stefan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Besides the natural physical interdependencies (e.g., water networks heavily depend on power grids, etc.), utility networks are nowadays often monitored and operated by industrial control systems (ICS). While these systems enhance the level of control over utility networks, they also enable new forms of attacks, such as cyberattacks. During the last years, cyberattacks have occurred more frequently with sometimes a significant impact on the company as well as the society. The first step toward preventing such incidents is to understand how an infection of one component influences the rest of the network. This malware spreading can be modeled as a stochastic process on a graph where edges transmit an infection with a specific probability. In practice, this probability depends on the type of the malware (e.g., ransomware, spyware, virus, etc.) as well as on the type of the connection between the nodes (e.g., physical or logical connections).

Thus, the protection of utilities that provision critical services (e.g., water, electricity, telecommunications) is of vital importance given the severity imposed by any failure of these services. Recent security incidents in the context of critical infrastructures indicate that threats in such environments appear to be increasing both in frequency and intensity. The complexity of typical critical infrastructures is among the factors that make these environments vulnerable to threats. One of the most problematic types of threat is an advanced persistent threat (APT). This usually refers to a sophisticated, targeted, and costly attack that employs multiple attack vectors to gain access to the target system, then to operate in stealth mode when penetration is achieved, and to exfiltrate data or cause failures inside the system. In this chapter, we demonstrate how a set of processes developed in the context of HyRiM’s framework can assist in minimizing the damage caused to a utility organization that is subjected to an APT style of attack. Specifically, the framework is demonstrated using data from a real-world water utility network and an industrial control system (ICS) test-bed, and in which optimal defensive strategies are investigated.","2018","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:37","313-333","","","","","","Protecting Water Utility Networks from Advanced Persistent Threats","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-75268-6_13","","","","","","Rass, Stefan; Schauer, Stefan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Besides the increasing rates of cyber-crime, recent terrorist attacks bring critical infrastructure into a severer environment. Many critical infrastructures, in particular those operating large industry complexes, incorporate some kind of physical surveillance technologies to secure their premises. Surveillance systems, such as access control and malicious behavior detection, have been long used for perimeter security as a first line of defense. Traditional perimeter security solutions typically monitor the outer boundary structures and lines, thus ignoring threats from the inside. Moreover, the deterrent effect of surveillance systems like Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) becomes considerably less important due to the inflexibility induced by their fixed installations. Hence, an infrastructure’s surveillance policy is more predictable and a potential adversary has a better opportunity to observe and bypass it subsequently. Therefore, it is important to maintain situational awareness within such environments so that potential intruders can still be detected. Regardless of whether personnel (e.g., security guards, etc.) or technical solutions (e.g., cameras, etc.) are applied, such surveillance systems have an imperfect detection rate, leaving an intruder with the potential to cause some damage to the infrastructure. Hence, the core problem is to find an optimal application of the surveillance technology at hand to minimize such a potential damage. This problem already has a natural reflection in game theory known as cops-and-robbers game but current models always assume a deterministic outcome of the gameplay. In this work, we present a decision-making framework, which assesses possible choices and alternatives towards finding an optimal surveillance configurations and hence minimizing addressed risks. The decision is made by means of a game-theoretic model for optimizing physical surveillance systems and minimizing the potential damage caused by an intruder with respect to the imperfect detection rates of surveillance technology. With our approach, we have the advantage of using categorical (or continuous) distributions instead of a single numerical value to capture the uncertainty in describing the potential damage of an intruder. This gives us the opportunity to model the imperfection of surveillance systems and to optimize over large collections of empirical or simulated data without losing valuable information during the process.","2018","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:37","129-156","","","","","","G-DPS","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-75268-6_6","","","","","","Rass, Stefan; Schauer, Stefan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this end, we establish a game-theoretic framework to capture the system behaviors of the CIs under malicious attacks and the security design objectives. We propose the factored Markov game theory to enable a computationally scalable model of large-scale infrastructure networks and provide approximate algorithms for designing optimal mechanisms. The proposed theory builds on the factored graph that exploits the dependency structure of the nodes of CIs and the approximate dynamic programming tools for stochastic Markov games. This work focuses on a localized information structure and the single-controller game solvable by linear programming. Numerical results illustrate the proper trade-off of the approximation accuracy and computation complexity in the new design paradigm and show the proactive security at the time of unanticipated attacks.","2018","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:37","99-126","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-75268-6_5","","","","","","Rass, Stefan; Schauer, Stefan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the online tool “Smart SECPLAN” has been created and used to guide information technology (IT) and operations technology (OT) security operators in an asset-driven risk assessment exercise following a step by step approach. The scenario chosen has been a medium-size electrical cooperative distribution system operator (DSO), who manages the distribution of the electricity. The Smart SECPLAN tool goes beyond existing risk assessment methods and techniques by providing advanced analytics based on a game theory model. For the experimental evaluation, we compared a classical game model to a model where the payoffs are fully stochastic (distribution-valued). This adds more analytic possibilities and flexibility. Our finding is that distribution-valued games require a more careful and involved modeling of losses (damages) but, upon a decent and accurate loss model, provide interesting insights and possibilities to understand a defense’s consequences at a very fine-grained level. As a major benefit of the tool, a prioritized set of mitigation actions is delivered, and a draft Gantt chart is proposed to manage the mitigation activities.","2018","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:37","391-418","","","","","","Smart SECPLAN","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-75268-6_16","","","","","","Rass, Stefan; Schauer, Stefan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Game theory can help finding optimal strategies against any possible behavior, provided that the attacker stays within a known action space. This is the typical domain and case of security risk management, where a set of threats is identified, against which a uniformly best defense is sought. In game-theoretic terms, the threat list corresponds to an action space, and the best defense against that list is a security strategy. This chapter discusses how such strategies can be computed for single and multiple protection goals, even when the effects of the defense actions are nondeterministic (random). The latter especially admits a treatment of uncertainty in three forms, being about the adversary (form and number), the attacker(s) incentives, and – to a limited extent – also the action space (threat list) itself.

Using noncooperative game theory, we analyze the behavior of an attacker and a defender. The attacker tries to compromise communication equipment to cause the maximum impact on the power grid. On the other hand, the defender tries to protect the power system by hardening the security on communication equipment, while taking into account the existence of backup control equipment in the communication infrastructure. We analyze different types of interactions between the attacker and the defender and propose methodologies to assess the initial security risk on communication equipment and the parameters of the analytical model used to evaluate the impact of equipment failures in the power system.

Although surveillance systems may be in place and operating within a utility provider’s premises, they are prone to technical as well as organizational failures resulting in a fluctuating performance. Furthermore, several emergency and unforeseen events, such as human errors, can significantly impact the effectiveness of specific surveillance activities. Therefore, modeling surveillance needs to account for the characteristics and practicalities of surveillance systems, especially imperfect detection as well as fuzzy assessment of the performance. To cope with this challenge, we apply game theory principles to solve zero-sum games with probability distribution-valued payoffs as a means to integrate the intrinsic uncertainty of surveillance systems. This model is an essential component of a comprehensive decision-making framework for physical surveillance games, called “G-DPS-framework”. The ultimate goal of this framework is to find the optimal configuration for physical surveillance system over multiple goals. As an evaluation scenario, we will use the actual setup given within a critical infrastructure, henceforth referred to as “the company”. For reasons of simplicity, we will focus solely on the use of security guards, who are controlling the area. Taking into account the details of the physical infrastructure (buildings, roads, etc.) as well as personnel requirements (working hours, available number of guards, etc.), we will make use of simulations to assess various real-life attack and defense scenarios with regard to different identified goals.

The defender is unable to perfectly observe attacks and the network’s security status and instead must use its imperfect observations to determine a defense strategy. The nature of the defender’s imperfect information is assumed to be non-probabilistic. Thus, the defender takes a conservative (minmax) approach to defending the network, attempting to construct a defense policy that minimizes the worst-case damage. Determining an optimal minmax defense strategy proves to be computationally intractable even for small-scale networks. To address this dimensionality issue, we propose a scalable decomposition method which involves the construction of multiple local defense problems, each equipped with a corresponding local defense policy. The local defense policies communicate information with one another with the goal of achieving network-wide security. The local defense problem’s construction is based on a decomposition of the network into clusters. For the decomposition, we use the notion of an influence graph to describe the dependencies among the security states of the network’s nodes. These dependencies, along with the available computational capability, are used to determine clusters of nodes, with each cluster corresponding to a local defense problem. After clusters are specified, we design the information structure of the network, that is, the information each local defense problem has over time to defend its own cluster; this information includes the data the local defense problem gathers from the environment along with the data communicated by other local defense policies. We illustrate the decomposition methodology with an example.","2018","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:47","2025-07-17 05:12:37","75-98","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-75268-6_4","","","","","","Rass, Stefan; Schauer, Stefan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite such benefits, concern over cyber security deters many large organizations with sensitive information to use a public cloud such as the Department of Defense. This is because different public cloud users share a common platform such as the hypervisor. An attacker can compromise a virtual machine (VM) to launch an attack on the hypervisor which, if compromised, can instantly yield the compromising of all the VMs running on top of that hypervisor. In this paper we evaluate the cloud user-attacker dynamic using game theory, which models competition among rational agents.

Despite its enormous impacts, customers are still reluctant to outsource their business processes because of security concerns. As data is typically stored and governed by cloud vendors, users need to deal with security issues linked to the loss of control over their sensitive data. Cloud providers need to implement the appropriate security measures that might attract more clients while making the minimum investment. While used in various disciplines, game theory has recently expanded to investigate the effect of the defenders’ and attackers’ behaviors on strategic decision-making. This study aims to develop insights into how game theory can develop better security policies in cloud computing. First, we perform threat modeling to identify the potential threats facing cloud. Second, we identify the limitations of existing game based solutions and then suggest an improved model define an adequate strategy that would figure out the right balance between the required security level and the profit margins.

This volume seeks to set the agenda for economic research on the impact of AI. It covers four broad themes: AI as a general purpose technology; the relationships between AI, growth, jobs, and inequality; regulatory responses to changes brought on by AI; and the effects of AI on the way economic research is conducted. It explores the economic influence of machine learning, the branch of computational statistics that has driven much of the recent excitement around AI, as well as the economic impact of robotics and automation and the potential economic consequences of a still-hypothetical artificial general intelligence. The volume provides frameworks for understanding the economic impact of AI and identifies a number of open research questions.

Numerous blackouts confirmed its importance for the functioning of the economy and its subjects in Ukraine, 2022. Therefore, the issue of ensuring the security of the functioning and development of the energy industry is at the level of national security. It is the basis of existence and creation of products and services for business entities. The historical lessons of energy disasters have demonstrated the need to find effective technologies for the interaction of business and the energy sector of Ukraine, which allow predicting, preventing and eliminating the consequences of accidents and incidents, balancing between environmental and economic security, as well as preventing the loss of human life and health. Such questions become relevant for scientific research and practical tests due to artificial intelligence and its symbiosis with human potential. The article reveals the components of business economic security and substantiates the key aspects of the energy sector in the system of business economic security. There is offered a range of software products using artificial intelligence and machine learning to support management decisions.

Based on the considered logical constructions, we propose syntax and set-theoretic interpretation of n-valued description logic ALCQn that provides the means for describing concept intersection, union, complement, value restrictions, and qualitative and quantitative constraints. We consider the means for solving key problems of reasoning over such logics: executability, augmentation, equivalence, and disjunctivity. As an algorithm for calculating the executability degree, we consider an extension of the tableau algorithm often used for first-order logic with solving simple numerical constraints.

About the individual behavior patterns, the authors find that human players prefer short-term periods to AI in decision-making. The interaction relationship analysis reveals a dynamic relationship between possible short-term co-movement and nearly counter-movement in the long run.

IAs can reinforce societal biases and lead to prosocial outcomes as well as social ills. IAs have culturally evolved rapidly with human usage, creating new affordances and new problems for the dynamics of social interaction.

Although such cybersecurity research is important, few have paid attention to the dynamic interactions between attackers and defenders, where both sides are intelligent and will dynamically change their attack or defense strategies in order to gain the upper hand over their opponents. This 'cyberwar' phenomenon exists among most cybersecurity incidents in the real world, which warrants special research and analysis. In this paper, we propose a dynamic game theoretic framework (i.e., hyper defense) to analyze the interactions between the attacker and the defender as a non-cooperative security game. The key idea is to model attackers/defenders to have multiple levels of attack/defense strategies that are different in terms of effectiveness, strategy costs, and attack gains/damages. Each player adjusts his strategy based on the strategy's cost, potential attack gain/damage, and effectiveness in anticipating of the opponent's strategy. We study the achievable Nash equilibrium for the attacker-defender security game where the players employ an efficient strategy according to the obtained equilibrium. Furthermore, we present case studies of three different types of network attacks and put forth how our hyper defense system can successfully model them. Simulation results show that the proposed game theoretical system achieves a better performance compared to two other fixed-strategy defense systems.","2018-05","2025-07-17 05:53:03","2025-07-17 05:53:03","2025-07-17 05:53:03","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 1938-1883","","","","","Computational modeling; Computer security; Games; Heuristic algorithms; Nash equilibrium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Games may involve multiple attackers and defenders over multiple periods. Defense involves security screening and inspection, the detection of invaders, jamming, secrecy, and deception. Incomplete information is reviewed due to its inevitable presence in cyber security. The findings pertain to players sharing information weighted against the security investment, influenced by social planning. Attackers stockpile zero-day cyber vulnerabilities. Defenders build deterrent resilient systems. Stochastic cyber security games play a role due to uncertainty and the need to build probabilistic models. Such games can be further developed. Cyber security games based on traffic and transportation are reviewed; they are influenced by the more extensive communication of GPS data.

Methodologies and terminology are described, including strategic choices, the use of probability theory, and equilibrium and minmax solutions. The review proceeds through defense and attack in reliability systems, and the related concept of system survivability which is the probability that a system continues functioning upon attack. A defender and an attacker allocate resources into preserving and operating versus disrupting or destroying targets (components). Thereafter multiple-target attacker-defender games are reviewed, at multiple levels, and followed by interdependence between targets. That is relevant since an attack on or disruption of one target may impact other targets, which impacts the defender's resource allocation across targets and the attacker's strategy. Interdiction strategies to preserve and disrupt, respectively, the operation of networks are analyzed. For example, society seeks to preserve infrastructure networks, and disrupt flows of illegal drugs and enemy troops. The review highlights how cascading failures influence strategic decision-making, requiring adaptive security mechanisms. Research on electric power grids and transportation networks is examined, demonstrating how attacker-defender interactions impact critical infrastructure resilience. By systematically classifying gametheoretic models, this review identifies key methodological advancements in attacker-defender equilibrium modeling, stochastic risk assessment, and resilience optimization. Future research directions are assessed, emphasizing the need for dynamic reliability modeling, multi-agent frameworks, and empirical validation to enhance real-world applicability.

In the meantime, LLMs have also gained traction in the security community, revealing security vulnerabilities and showcasing their potential in security-related tasks. This paper explores the intersection of LLMs with security and privacy. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs positively impact security and privacy, potential risks and threats associated with their use, and inherent vulnerabilities within LLMs. Through a comprehensive literature review, the paper categorizes the papers into “The Good” (beneficial LLM applications), “The Bad” (offensive applications), and “The Ugly” (vulnerabilities of LLMs and their defenses). We have some interesting findings. For example, LLMs have proven to enhance code security (code vulnerability detection) and data privacy (data confidentiality protection), outperforming traditional methods. However, they can also be harnessed for various attacks (particularly user-level attacks) due to their human-like reasoning abilities. We have identified areas that require further research efforts. For example, Research on model and parameter extraction attacks is limited and often theoretical, hindered by LLM parameter scale and confidentiality. Safe instruction tuning, a recent development, requires more exploration. We hope that our work can shed light on the LLMs’ potential to both bolster and jeopardize cybersecurity.","2024-06-01","2025-07-17 05:54:37","2025-07-17 05:54:37","2025-07-17 05:54:37","100211","","2","4","","High-Confidence Computing","A survey on large language model (LLM) security and privacy","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","ChatGPT; Large Language Model (LLM); LLM attacks; LLM privacy; LLM security; LLM vulnerabilities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cyber threat intelligence provides decision-makers with the necessary information and context to understand and anticipate potential threats, reducing uncertainty, and improving the accuracy of risk analysis. The latter is a principal element of evidence-based decision-making, and it is essential to recognize that addressing uncertainty requires a new, threat-intelligence (TI) driven methodology, and risk analysis approach. We propose a solution to this challenge by introducing a TI-based security assessment methodology and a decision-making strategy that considers both known unknowns and unknown unknowns. The proposed methodology aims to enhance the quality of decision-making by utilizing causal graphs, which offer an alternative to conventional methodologies that rely on attack trees, resulting in a reduction of uncertainty. Furthermore, we consider tactics, techniques, and procedures that are possible, probable, and plausible, improving the predictability of adversary behavior.

Unfortunately, much work on cyber situational awareness has been technology-focused, despite the ultimate importance of human decisions, especially in crisis situations like real-time cyber-attacks and data breaches. Cybersecurity practitioners and leaders require an appropriate framework to help decision makers at all levels guide and act while managing risk in unexpected and dynamic situations. Without such a framework, failure to enlighten the unknown leads to heightened risk, uncertainty, and insecurity. The ability to establish context, adapt, and apply the most appropriate decision-making style to unique situations increases the likelihood of security. We offer an application of the Cynefin Framework, a sensemaking solution, to cybersecurity which allows practitioners and leaders to identify the context and appropriate response type in complex situations using the cause-and-effect relationship. We also illustrate how orienting oneself in the five Cynefin domains – disorder, obvious, complicated, complex, and chaotic – can help manage risk. By comparing Cynefin to other decision-making frameworks, we show how this framework is uniquely appropriate for acting through complexity and risk in cyber.","2016-10","2025-07-17 05:55:13","2025-07-17 05:55:13","2025-07-17 05:55:13","1-6","","","","","","Acting in the unknown","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","","","","Computer security; Context; cybersecurity; Cynefin Framework; decision making; Decision making; Hospitals; Organizations; risk management; sensemaking; situational awareness; Uncertainty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon U.S.)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The reach and influence of foreign-based network platforms present risks to American society and require us to confront questions about their origin and purpose. Meanwhile, AI technologies are enhancing several existing national security threats, and will change the way states try to gain leverage against adversaries and exercise coercion and influence in other societies. The open nature of free and democratic societies, combined with their increasing reliance on poorly secured digital networks, makes them especially vulnerable. In the military realm, AI holds the prospect of augmenting cyber, conventional, and nuclear capabilities in ways that make security relationships among rivals more challenging to predict and maintain, and conflicts more difficult to limit. Even as they compete, rivals should explore limits on AI capabilities. The AI ecosystems of the principal global competitors, the United States and China, remain intertwined, and a calibration of the bilateral technology relationship requires both selective decoupling and continued collaboration in areas of mutual interest.

This article considers another paradox, that relates to the fact that computational systems created using AI can be used both for public good in civilian applications and for harm across a range of application areas and settings [A1]. This contradiction is explored within an organizational and governmental context, where modern AI relies on data which might be externally or internally-sourced [A2]. External data sources [A3] are inclusive of open-source intelligence (OS-INT), such as information available on the Internet and the dark web, and internal data sources may include proprietary data found within an organizational or a wider governmental context [A4].

Practical implications and directions for further research are presented.,With its inception in economics, the concept of rationality has a rich history across multiple research domains. Based on that literature, coupled with the recent advancements in AI, the paper asks: will AI afford organizational leadership the ability to move from making bounded rational decisions to making fully rational decisions? The paper only scratches the surface of such a large question; however, the goal is to start the discussion around the topic.,While bounded rationality supports efficient decision-making, a complete understanding of any given decision is typically limited, and as a result, neither accuracy nor effectiveness is guaranteed. As AI systems grow in speed and accuracy, they should provide positive support for organizational leaders to make fully rational decisions. AI’s ability to collect and organize data, analyze it, and offer decision alternatives may help close the gap between bounded and rational decision-making.,Although AI research is not new, the recent developments in natural language processing engines has rapidly brought about new possibilities for their use in rational decision-making in the business and organizational context.

Next, the authors consider a rational decision-maker that forms a private belief (posterior distribution) on the state of the world by filtering private information. The authors show how to estimate such posterior distributions from observed optimal actions taken by the agent.

CPS have evolved in the past decades toward a higher-level of autonomy and a more decentralized and connected implementation. The evolution toward more autonomous systems has changed the computation and communication workloads, demanding particular care in the early design phases to avoid exceeding typical size, power, and cost constraints. Moreover, the use of approximate models, the complexity of the state estimation and controlled problems, and imperfect communications suggest that epistemic uncertainty will play a major role in these systems. After presenting the evolution of CPS over the past two decades, we review the main sources of uncertainty in classical CPS with emphasis on the implementation platform such as failures, timing, and implementation bugs. We present several classical methods to deal with uncertainty and explain why these methods, while still applicable to autonomous systems, are not sufficient.

Most of the existing literature on MARL concentrates on zero-sum Markov games but is not applicable to general-sum Markov games. It is known that the best response dynamics in general-sum Markov games are not a contraction. Therefore, different equilibria in general-sum Markov games can have different values. Moreover, the Q-function is not sufficient to completely characterize the equilibrium. Given these challenges, model-based learning is an attractive approach for MARL in general-sum Markov games. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental question of sample complexity for model-based MARL algorithms in general-sum Markov games. We show two results. We first use Hoeffding inequality-based bounds to show that $$\tilde{{\mathcal {O}}}( (1-\gamma )^{-4} \alpha ^{-2})$$samples per state–action pair are sufficient to obtain a $$\alpha $$-approximate Markov perfect equilibrium with high probability, where $$\gamma $$is the discount factor, and the $$\tilde{{\mathcal {O}}}(\cdot )$$notation hides logarithmic terms. We then use Bernstein inequality-based bounds to show that $$\tilde{{\mathcal {O}}}( (1-\gamma )^{-1} \alpha ^{-2} )$$samples are sufficient. To obtain these results, we study the robustness of Markov perfect equilibrium to model approximations. We show that the Markov perfect equilibrium of an approximate (or perturbed) game is always an approximate Markov perfect equilibrium of the original game and provide explicit bounds on the approximation error. We illustrate the results via a numerical example.","2023-03-01","2025-07-17 05:58:57","2025-07-17 05:58:57","2025-07-17 05:58:57","56-88","","1","13","","Dyn Games Appl","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\Q7TXZ73S\Subramanian et al. - 2023 - Robustness and Sample Complexity of Model-Based MARL for General-Sum Markov Games.pdf","","","Algorithmic Complexity; Complexity; Computational Complexity; Game Theory; Markov Process; Stochastic Learning and Adaptive Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our model generalizes several contagion models in the literature, particularly the independent cascade model and the linear threshold model. We state various limit theorems on the final size of infected agents in the case of random networks with given vertex degrees for finite and infinite-variance degree distributions. The results allow us to derive a resilience condition for the network in response to the infection of a large group of agents and quantify how contagion amplifies small shocks to the network. We show that when the degree distribution has infinite variance and highly correlated in- and out-degrees, even when agents have high thresholds, a sub-linear fraction of initially infected agents is enough to trigger the infection of a positive fraction of nodes. We also demonstrate how these results are sensitive to vertex and edge percolation (intervention). We then study the asymptotic Nash equilibrium and socially optimal security investment. In the asymptotic limit, agents’ risk depends on all other agents’ investments through an aggregate quantity that we call network vulnerability. The limit theorems enable us to capture the impact of one class of agents’ decisions on the overall network vulnerability. Based on our results, the vulnerability is semi-analytic, allowing for a tractable Nash equilibrium. We provide sufficient conditions for investment in equilibrium to be monotone in network vulnerability. When investment is monotone, we demonstrate that the (asymptotic) Nash equilibrium is unique. In the specific example of two types of core-periphery agents, we illustrate the strong effect of cost heterogeneity on network vulnerability and the non-monotonous investment as a function of costs.","2023-06-01","2025-07-17 06:00:01","2025-07-17 06:00:01","2025-07-17 06:00:01","247-283","","2","17","","Math Finan Econ","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","C70; Contagion; D62; Dynamic Networks; G18; Game Theory; Homeostasis, Perturbations, and Biological Networks; Random graphs; Risk Management; Risk Theory; Security investment; Stochastic networks; Stochastic Networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this end, an evolutionary game model of group decision-making is proposed to analyze the behavioral change process of the defender population. In particular, we first introduce the concept of observation error and short-term prediction in network communication and establish an improved selection–drift dynamics in which errors are automatically corrected to a certain extent and the convergence speed is faster than the prototype. By calculating the stable evolutionary equilibrium of the defender population, the optimal group decision-making approach is formulated. Case studies on big data vulnerabilities indicate that the proposed model and approach perform better in robustness and computational efficiency than the 3 typical models under jamming environments.","2023-09-01","2025-07-17 06:00:11","2025-07-17 06:00:11","2025-07-17 06:00:11","980-1004","","3","13","","Dyn Games Appl","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Clonal selection; Cybersecurity; Decision Making; Decision-making; Evolutionary game theory; Game Theory; Group Dynamics; Improved selection–drift dynamics; Optimal defense strategy; Policy Formulation; Security Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The agent however can only estimate these sets. The application to the co-emergence model of reinforcement in psychology offers to reconsider situations usually seen as resulting from a feedback loop in terms of controlled differential inclusion. It allows for assessing the effect of a treatment to which the patient may respond in a volatile way. The second application to empirical data of anticipated survival over a 15-year horizon shows the mismatch between actual and estimated congruence, with consequences for future consumption planning. A third case concerns time inconsistency in behavioral economics: The capture basin of the target reflecting an agent’s preference for a good at a given date over this increased good at a later date determines all the initial growth rates of the discount factor for which such a preference holds true. Congruence of a given initial growth rate with the target allows for identifying all trajectories that resolve time inconsistency from this growth rate. The formulation of congruence in terms of differential inclusions between agent and objective therefore makes it possible to develop on the original formulation of affordance in a context of non-normative behaviors.","2025-03-03","2025-07-17 07:02:05","2025-07-17 07:02:05","2025-07-17 07:02:05","","","","","","Differ Equ Dyn Syst","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Action Theory; Anticipated survival; Cognitivism; Conceptual Analysis; Dynamical systems; Goal attainment; Humanistic Psychology; Life development; Mind-Body Problem/Body-Soul Problem; Set-valued analysis; Utilitarianism; Viability theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we assess the prospects for stronger global AI governance and consider potential pathways forward. We map the nascent landscape of international regimes focused on AI governance and conclude that a governance deficit remains due to the inadequacy of existing initiatives, gaps in the landscape and difficulties reaching agreement over more appropriate mechanisms. First-order cooperation problems stemming from interstate competition and second-order cooperation problems from dysfunctional international institutions problematise overcoming current deficiencies in global AI governance.  In light of these cooperation problems, we evaluate two pathways for strengthening global AI governance: (a) developing new centralised international AI institution(s) and (b) strengthening coordination between, and capacities of, existing institutions. We argue that strengthening the existing weak ‘regime complex’ of international institutions is the more politically legitimate and viable path forward. Improving coordination between, and capacities of, existing international institutions governing AI would support inclusive and mutually reinforcing policy change that can mitigate a range of risks associated with these technologies. As first steps for strengthening the weak AI regime complex, we recommend that the OECD is foregrounded as a centre of expert AI knowledge so that it can facilitate peer pressure among states and harmonisation of policies. We also encourage scrutiny of different nodes in the regime complex to ensure that they are fulfilling appropriate functions based on their democratic mandates.","2023-09-29","2025-07-17 07:07:32","2025-07-17 07:07:32","2025-07-17 07:07:32","","","","","","","Global AI governance","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","","","","","","AI governance; ethics; global governance; international cooperation; regime complex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4588040","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such normalisations are essential, as they provide both a propensity-based perspective on crime (e.g. the odds of being murdered are 1 in 100,000) and correct for the simple fact that a larger population should have more crimes. Unfortunately, many cybersecurity metrics tend to be uncorrected counts of malicious phenomena such as the number of phishing websites. While normalisation cannot make bad measures good, a failure to normalise even the best cybersecurity metrics can lead to bias. A failure to normalise count statistics around the size of the ecosystem, sensor density or risk mitigation personnel has implications for the observed trends, often making the state of cybersecurity seem worse than it actually is. In short, normalisation of malicious count data is a crucial measurement step and has significant impacts for both firm- and economy-wide risk management strategies and policy assessment.","2018-01-02","2025-07-17 07:08:29","2025-07-17 07:08:29","2025-07-17 07:08:29","116-139","","1","3","","","Mind the denominator","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/23738871.2018.1472288","","","","","cybersecurity; Measurement; policy effectiveness; risk management; vulnerabilities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we present a multivariate model for different, dependent types of attack and the effect of mitigation strategies on those attacks. Utilising collected cyber attack data and assumptions on mitigation approaches, we look at an example of using the model to optimise the choice of mitigations. We find that the optimal choice of mitigations will depend on the goal—to prevent extreme damages or damage on average. Numerical experiments suggest the dependence aspect is important and can alter final risk estimates by as much as 30%. The methodology can be used to quantify the cost of cyber attacks and support decision making on the choice of optimal mitigation strategies.","2020-06","2025-07-17 08:00:30","2025-07-17 08:00:30","2025-07-17 08:00:30","61","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 2 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\IK4TCQ6D\Bentley et al. - 2020 - A Multivariate Model to Quantify and Mitigate Cybersecurity Risk.pdf","","","cyber risk; operational risk; optimal mitigations; value at risk (VaR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"PLMD6A7P","book","2021","Das, Ravi","Assessing and Insuring Cybersecurity Risk","","978-1-003-02368-5","","","","Remote workforces using VPNs, cloud-based infrastructure and critical systems, and a proliferation in phishing attacks and fraudulent websites are all raising the level of risk for every company. It all comes down to just one thing that is at stake: how to gauge a company’s level of cyber risk and the tolerance level for this risk. Loosely put, this translates to how much uncertainty an organization can tolerate before it starts to negatively affect mission critical flows and business processes. Trying to gauge this can be a huge and nebulous task for any IT security team to accomplish. Making this task so difficult are the many frameworks and models that can be utilized. It is very confusing to know which one to utilize in order to achieve a high level of security. Complicating this situation further is that both quantitative and qualitative variables must be considered and deployed into a cyber risk model. Assessing and Insuring Cybersecurity Risk provides an insight into how to gauge an organization’s particular level of cyber risk, and what would be deemed appropriate for the organization’s risk tolerance. In addition to computing the level of cyber risk, an IT security team has to determine the appropriate controls that are needed to mitigate cyber risk. Also to be considered are the standards and best practices that the IT security team has to implement for complying with such regulations and mandates as CCPA, GDPR, and the HIPAA. To help a security team to comprehensively assess an organization’s cyber risk level and how to insure against it, the book covers:  The mechanics of cyber risk Risk controls that need to be put into place The issues and benefits of cybersecurity risk insurance policies GDPR, CCPA, and the the CMMC Gauging how much cyber risk and uncertainty an organization can tolerate is a complex and complicated task, and this book helps to make it more understandable and manageable.","2021-10-07","2025-07-17 08:00:37","2025-07-17 08:00:37","","","166","","","","","","","","","","Auerbach Publications","New York","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1201/9781003023685","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we use the model to classify empirical cyber harm studies. We discover cyber harms are not exceptional in terms of typical or extreme losses. The increasing frequency of data breaches is contested and stock market reactions to cyber incidents are becoming less damaging over time. Focusing on harms alone breeds fatalism; the causal model is most useful in evaluating the effectiveness of security interventions. We show how simple statistical relationships lead to spurious results in which more security spending or applying updates are associated with greater rates of compromise. When accounting for threat and exposure, indicators of security are shown to be important factors in explaining the variance in rates of compromise, especially when the studies use multiple indicators of the security level.","2021-05","2025-07-17 08:00:45","2025-07-17 08:00:45","2025-07-17 08:00:45","211-228","","","","","","SoK","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2375-1207","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\LHGGA6ZL\Woods and Böhme - 2021 - SoK Quantifying Cyber Risk.pdf","","","causal model; control effectiveness; cyber harm; cyber risk; Focusing; Mathematical model; Privacy; Risk management; science of security; Security; security metrics; Software; structural equation modeling; Time-frequency analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article presents a model and methodology to leverage on the large amount of data available from the IT infrastructure of an organization's security operation center to quantitatively estimate the probability of attack. Our methodology specifically addresses untargeted attacks delivered by automatic tools that make up the vast majority of attacks in the wild against users and organizations. We consider two-stage attacks whereby the attacker first breaches an Internet-facing system, and then escalates the attack to internal systems by exploiting local vulnerabilities in the target. Our methodology factors in the power of the attacker as the number of “weaponized” vulnerabilities he/she can exploit, and can be adjusted to match the risk appetite of the organization. We illustrate our methodology by using data from a large financial institution, and discuss the significant mismatch between traditional qualitative risk assessments and our quantitative approach.","2017","2025-07-17 08:00:51","2025-07-17 08:00:51","2025-07-17 08:00:51","1606-1627","","8","37","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2017 Society for Risk Analysis","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/risa.12864","","","","","Attack likelihood; cybersecurity events; quantitative risk; vulnerabilities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, risk assessment can be a complicated process for organizations. Therefore, many authors have attempted to automate this step using qualitative and quantitative tools. The problems with the tools and the risk assessment stage in general are (1) not considering all the sub-steps of risk assessment and (2) not identifying the variables necessary for an accurate risk calculation. To address these issues, this article presents a systematic mapping review (SMR) of tools that automate the cybersecurity risk assessment stage based on studies published in the last decade. As a result, we identify and describe 35 tools from 40 primary studies. Most of the primary studies were published between 2012 and 2020, indicating an upward trend of cyber risk assessment tool publication in recent years. The main objectives of this paper are to: (I) identify the differences (reference models and applications) and coverage of the main qualitative and quantitative models, (II) identify relevant risk assessment variables, (III) propose a risk assessment model (qualitative and quantitative) that considers the main variables and sub-stages of risk assessment stage, and (IV) obtain an assessment of the proposed model by experts in the field of cybersecurity. The proposal was sent to a group of 28 cybersecurity experts who approved the proposed variables and their relevance in the cybersecurity risk assessment stage, identifying a majority use of qualitative tools but a preference of experts for quantitative tools.","2023-01","2025-07-17 08:01:07","2025-07-17 08:01:07","2025-07-17 08:01:07","395","","1","13","","","Cybersecurity Risk Assessment","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\BEJT529J\Sánchez-García et al. - 2023 - Cybersecurity Risk Assessment A Systematic Mapping Review, Proposal, and Validation.pdf","","","algorithms; automation; cybersecurity; cybersecurity experts; experimentation; proposal; risk assessment; systematic mapping review; tools; validation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They contribute to meeting the day-to-day needs (e.g., power, water, manufacturing, transportation) of the civilian society, alongside making societal businesses more efficient, productive, and profitable. However, it is also well known that IoT devices often operate on poorly configured security settings. This increases the chances of occurrence of (nation-sponsored) stealthy spread-based APT malware attacks in IIoT networks that might go undetected over a considerable period of time. Such attacks usually generate a negative first-party QoS impact with financial consequences for companies owning such IIoT network infrastructures. This impact spans (i.e., aggregates) space (i.e., the entire IIoT network or a sub-network) and time (i.e., duration of business disruption), and is a measure of significant interest to managers running their businesses atop such networks. It is of little use to network resilience boosting managers if they have to wait for a cyber-attack to happen to gauge this impact. Consequently, one of the questions that intrigues us is: can managers estimate this first-party impact prior to APT cyber-attack(s) causing financial damage to companies?In this paper, we propose the first computationally efficient and quantitative network theory framework to (a) characterize this first-party impact apriori as a statistical distribution over multiple attack configurations in a family of malware-driven APT cyber-attacks specifically launched on businesses running atop IIoT networks, (b) accurately compute the statistical moments (e.g., mean) of the resulting impact distribution, and (c) tightly bound the accuracy of worst-case risk estimate of such a distribution - captured through the tail of the distribution, using the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) metric. In relation to (a) above, our methodology extends the seminal Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) cyber-risk quantification methodology that does not explicitly account for network interconnections among system-risk contributing variables. We validate the effectiveness of our theory using trace-driven Monte Carlo simulations based upon test-bed experiments conducted in the FIT IoT-Lab. We further illustrate quantitatively that even if spread-based APT cyber-attacks induce a statistically light-tailed first-party cyber-loss distribution on an IIoT networked enterprise in the worst case, the aggregate multi-party cyber-risk distribution incurred by the same enterprise in supply-chain ecosystems could be heavy-tailed. This will pose significant market scale-up challenges to cyber-security improving commercial cyber (re-)insurance businesses. We subsequently propose managerial action items to mitigate the first-party cyber-risk exposure emanating from any given IIoT driven enterprise.","2023-10-19","2025-07-17 08:01:23","2025-07-17 08:01:23","2025-07-17 08:01:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","Just Accepted","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\4A7Y6N7R\Pal et al. - 2023 - How Should Enterprises Quantify and Analyze (Multi-Party) APT Cyber-Risk Exposure in their Industria.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a virtual reality (VR) setting we performed an experiment investigating the progression from fast, automatic decisions towards more controlled decisions over multiple trials in the context of a sacrificing scenario. We repeatedly exposed participants to a modified ten-to-one version and to three one-to-one versions of the trolley dilemma in VR and varied avatar properties, such as their gender and ethnicity, and their orientation in space. We also investigated the influence of arousing music on decisions. Our experiment replicated the behavioral pattern observed in studies using text versions of the trolley dilemma, thereby validating the use of virtual environments in research on moral judgments. Additionally, we found a general tendency towards sacrificing male individuals which correlated with socially desirable responding. As indicated by differences in response times, the ten-to-one version of the trolley dilemma seems to be faster to decide than decisions requiring comparisons based on specific avatar properties as a result of differing moral content. Building upon research on music-based emotion induction, we used music to induce emotional arousal on a physiological level as measured by pupil diameter. We found a specific temporal signature displaying a peak in arousal around the moment of decision. This signature occurs independently of the overall arousal level. Furthermore, we found context-dependent gaze durations during sacrificing decisions, leading participants to look prolonged at their victim if they had to choose between avatars differing in gender. Our study confirmed that moral decisions can be explained within the framework of dual-process theories and shows that pupillometric measurements are a promising tool for investigating affective responses in dilemma situations.","2014-12-16","2025-07-17 08:02:07","2025-07-17 08:02:07","2025-07-17 08:02:07","","","","8","","Front.

These challenges have recently been raised by ethicists, computer scientists, and policymakers. More specifically, existing frameworks are encountering challenges such as the difficulties that come along with defining an AI, adapting to the needs of the public in participating in democratic governance, and considering the environmental impacts of these systems. After critically reviewing the three challenges, this paper proposes alternative regulatory approaches to address each of these regulatory challenges. To address the definition challenge, we propose a multidimensional approach to defining AI. We argue that a relational approach can be helpful for making visible the cultural context in which AI systems are embedded. Finally, we suggest that involving a systematic environmental studies approach in assessing AI is conducive to the development of not only more environmentally friendly AI systems but also AI technologies that can be used to address challenging global environmental issues.","2022-11","2025-07-17 08:02:14","2025-07-17 08:02:14","2025-07-17 08:02:14","1-5","","","1","","","Critical Reflections on the Ethical Regulation of AI","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2158-3412","","","","","AI ethics; AI regulation; artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence; Complexity theory; Cultural differences; ethical governance; ethical regulation; Ethics; Reflection; Regulation; regulation framework; Systematics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It reveals potential in cybersecurity-related tasks such as social engineering. Nevertheless, this possibility raises important concerns regarding the thin line separating moral use of this technology from its harmful usage. It is imperative to address the challenges of distinguishing between legitimate and malevolent use of ChatGPT. This research paper investigates the many concerns of ChatGPT in cybersecurity, privacy and enterprise settings. It covers harmful attacker uses such as injecting malicious prompts, testing brute force attacks, preparing and developing ransomware attacks, etc. Defenders’ proactive activities are also addressed, highlighting ChatGPT’s significance in security operations and threat intelligence. These defensive operations are classified based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework. They involve analyzing configuration files, inquiring about authoritative server, improving security in various systems, etc. Moreover, secure enterprise practices and mitigations spread through five classes are proposed, with an emphasis on clear usage standards and guidelines establishment, personally identifiable information protection, adversarial attack prevention, watermarking generated content, etc. An integrated discussion digs into the interaction of offensive and defensive applications, covering ethical and practical concerns. Future attacks are also discussed, along with potential solutions such as content filtering and collaboration. Finally, a comparative analysis with recent research on ChatGPT security concerns is directed. The paper provides a thorough framework to comprehend the range of implications associated with ChatGPT, enabling the navigation of cybersecurity and privacy challenges.","2024","2025-07-17 08:02:19","2025-07-17 08:02:19","2025-07-17 08:02:19","30263-30310","","","12","","","ChatGPT’s Security Risks and Benefits","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\MC9FI42R\Charfeddine et al. - 2024 - ChatGPT’s Security Risks and Benefits Offensive and Defensive Use-Cases, Mitigation Measures, and F.pdf","","","Artificial intelligence; Chatbots; ChatGPT; computer crime; Computer security; cyberattack; Cyberattack; cyberethics; cybersecurity; defense industry; Ethics; Guidelines; NIST Standards; NLP; privacy; Privacy; Security; Watermarking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is problematic because the consequences of uncertainty shocks outstrip the predictability capacity for the average manager and entail a greater complexity of internal and external factors. Moreover, their uniqueness makes translating experience into learning far more difficult. We seek to address this inadequate approach with a theoretical framework that captures the multidimensional complexity of organizations preparing for, coping with, and recovering from exogenous uncertain disruption. We bring together the literatures on cognitive psychology that suggest that biases and heuristics drive behavior under uncertainty, a Neo-Carnegie perspective that indicates that organizational structure and strategy regulate these behavioral factors, and institutional theory that points to stakeholder and institutional dynamics affecting economic incentives to invest in prevention and business continuity. Taken together, this article offers the foundation for a behaviorally plausible, decision-centered perspective on organizational decision-making under uncertainty.","2018-08","2025-07-17 08:50:51","2025-07-17 08:50:51","2025-07-17 08:50:51","","","","","","","","","","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","Cambridge, MA","en","","","","","Crossref","","DOI: 10.3386/w24924","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\GQ2NRAPL\Ballesteros and Kunreuther - 2018 - Organizational Decision Making Under Uncertainty Shocks.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is consensus that IT has significant effects on the productivity of firms. These effects will only be realized if, and when, IT are widely spread and used. It is essential to understand the determinants of IT adoption. Consequently it is necessary to know the theoretical models. There are few reviews in the literature about the comparison of IT adoption models at the individual level, and to the best of our knowledge there are even fewer at the firm level. This review will fill this gap. In this study, we review theories for adoption models at the firm level used in information systems literature and discuss two prominent models: diffusion on innovation (DOI) theory, and the technology, organization, and environment (TOE) framework. The DOI found that individual characteristics, internal characteristics of organizational structure, and external characteristics of the organization are important antecedents to organizational innovativeness. The TOE framework identifies three aspects of an enterprise's context that influence the process by which it adopts and implements a technological innovation: technological context, organizational context, and environmental context. We made a thorough analysis of the TOE framework, analysing the studies that used only this theory and the studies that combine the TOE framework with other theories such as: DOI, institutional theory, and the Iacovou, Benbasat, and Dexter model. The institutional theory helps us to understand the factors that influence the adoption of interorganizational systems (IOSs); it postulates that mimetic, coercive, and normative institutional pressures existing in an institutionalized environment may influence the organization’s predisposition toward an IT-based interorganizational system. The Iacovou, Benbasat, and Dexter model, analyses IOSs characteristics that influence firms to adopt IT innovations. It is based on three contexts: perceived benefits, organizational readiness, and external pressure. The analysis of these models takes into account the empirical literature, and the difference between independent and dependent variables. The paper also makes recommendations for future research.","2011","2025-07-17 08:51:01","2025-07-17 08:51:01","2025-07-17 08:51:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Literature-Review-of-Information-Technology-Models-Oliveira-Martins/9ffe6034c0b8fef2079ce5d2142243cc6f75d2b6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Systems often fail because the organizations that defend them do not bear the full costs of failure. For instance, companies operating critical infrastructures have integrated control systems with the Internet to reduce near-term, measurable costs while raising the risk of catastrophic failures, whose losses will be primarily borne by society. As long as anti-virus software is left to individuals to purchase and install, there may be a less than optimal level of protection when infected machines cause trouble for other machines rather than their owners. In order to solve the problems of growing vulnerability and increasing crime, policy and legislation must coherently allocate responsibilities and liabilities so that the parties in a position to fix problems have an incentive to do so. In this paper, we examine the economic challenges that plague cybersecurity: misaligned incentives, information asymmetries, and externalities. We then discuss the regulatory options that are available to overcome these barriers in the cybersecurity context: ex ante safety regulation, ex post liability, information disclosure, and indirect intermediary liability. Finally, we make several recommendations for policy changes to improve cybersecurity: mitigating malware infections via ISPs by subsidized cleanup, mandatory disclosure of fraud losses and security incidents, mandatory disclosure of control system incidents and intrusions, and aggregating reports of cyber espionage and providing them to the World Trade Organization (WTO).","2010-12-01","2025-07-17 09:34:58","2025-07-17 09:34:58","2025-07-17 09:34:58","103-117","","3","3","","International Journal of Critical Infrastructure Protection","The economics of cybersecurity","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Economics; Externalities; Incentives; Information asymmetries; Information security; Intermediary liability; Malware; Payment card security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, most AI models are vulnerable to advanced and sophisticated hacking techniques. This challenge has motivated concerted research efforts into adversarial AI, with the aim of developing robust machine and deep learning models that are resilient to different types of adversarial scenarios. In this paper, we present a holistic cyber security review that demonstrates adversarial attacks against AI applications, including aspects such as adversarial knowledge and capabilities, as well as existing methods for generating adversarial examples and existing cyber defence models. We explain mathematical AI models, especially new variants of reinforcement and federated learning, to demonstrate how attack vectors would exploit vulnerabilities of AI models.

This paper discusses the rationale for these fears, highlighting the specific nature of AI and comparing previous waves of automation and robotization with the current advancements made possible by a widespread adoption of AI. It argues that large opportunities in terms of increases in productivity can ensue, including for developing countries, given the vastly reduced costs of capital that some applications have demonstrated and the potential for productivity increases, especially among the low skilled. At the same time, risks in the form of further increases in inequality need to be addressed if the benefits from AI-based technological progress are to be broadly shared. For this, skills policies are necessary but not sufficient. In addition, new forms of regulating the digital economy are called for that prevent further rises in market concentration, ensure proper data protection and privacy, and help share the benefits of productivity growth through the combination of profit sharing, (digital) capital taxation, and a reduction in working time. The paper calls for a moderately optimistic outlook on the opportunities and risks from AI, provided that policymakers and social partners take the particular characteristics of these new technologies into account.","2019-08-14","2025-07-17 09:45:20","2025-07-17 09:45:20","2025-07-17 09:45:20","","","1","9","","","Economics of Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","","","","Crossref","","Publisher: Walter de Gruyter GmbH","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\S4VZXRYH\Ernst et al. - 2019 - Economics of Artificial Intelligence Implications for the Future of Work.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, the employment of MUAI to specifically spread disinformation about COVID-19 represents a direct threat to the health security of the international community. Evidence suggests that malicious information infrastructures are being purposefully appropriated to advance disinformation about COVID-19, leading to overlapping health threats and IPS threats. We adopted an analytic approach that distinguishes meso-level national security and macro-level international and global security to explore the intersection of COVID-19, MUAI, and damaged IPS. Our analysis, which focused on cases in Central-Eastern Europe and the US, allowed us to trace idiosyncratic national features and more general global aspects of the ongoing mega-crisis.

The frequency of political campaigns—predominantly electoral—and globalization makes us face a real universalized political campaign, in which territorial boundaries matter less. AI has a rapidly increasing impact on how citizens seek, receive, impart, and access information in political campaigns and elections, especially through online platforms and social media networks. These platforms use AI as part of highly complex and opaque systems to curate content, resulting in a significant impact on freedom of expression. A wise legislator must understand that the strength of AI can collide with the reasoning processes of people, leading to serious disorders of the psyche—both individually and in groups—that can create dangerous behaviors in public space, disrupting important levels of society. Thus, it becomes necessary to study the effects that the malicious use of artificial intelligence will have on the psychology of people, as well as the general security of society and states, with the goal of creating a new international and national legal framework to prevent and sanction any AI use that is outside the moral limits stipulated by that framework.","2023","2025-07-17 09:45:44","2025-07-17 09:45:44","2025-07-17 09:45:41","203-230","","","","","","Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence in Political Campaigns","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-22552-9_8","","","","","","Pashentsev, Evgeny","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Besides pushing targeted and personalized content perceived by users as more persuasive, algorithmic innovations in “affect recognition” have given artificially intelligent agents the ability to exploit the emotional state of social media users. On encrypted social media channels, such social media bots are especially useful to extremist groups which lack human and financial resources to enact large-scale psychological warfare campaigns. As newer generations of social bots grow their ability to read and respond to human emotions and, in turn, increase their anthropomorphic tendencies, we argue that these automated headhunters will play a dominant role in online radicalization. This chapter undertakes a qualitative study of the affective role of conversational AI in establishing an emotional relationship with potential recruits in online radicalization. We also assess current efforts by Western security agencies, social media companies, and academic researchers to counter online radicalization strategies by extremist organizations.

The first trend distorts the second, causing growing threats of malicious use of artificial intelligence (MUAI) to erode psychological security. MUAI, in turn, contributes to the destabilization of human consciousness, which contributes to the destabilization of society, which contributes once again to the destabilization of human consciousness—a dangerous, unsustainable cycle—aiming to “win” in the global distribution of assets.

However, the malicious use of deepfakes (MUD) is a current social problem that threatens to inflict extensive damage on individuals, democratic institutions, social stability, and international security. This chapter aims to analyze the current practice of MUD, its role in destabilizing psychological security and political stability. The systemic approach adopted in this study seeks to avoid one-sided assessments, by providing an objective analysis of the interrelated aspects of the development and use of deepfakes. The use of the dialectical method suggests that any phenomenon should be considered in light of the duality of its properties and characteristics, in order to find contradictions and mutual disposition (e.g., objective connection, unity, and dependence). This is particularly important for this case of dual-use technology which, due to the nature of social relations in modern society, can be deliberately used to either benefit or harm people.","2023","2025-07-17 09:45:44","2025-07-17 09:45:44","2025-07-17 09:45:41","47-80","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-22552-9_3","","","","","","Pashentsev, Evgeny","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This potential impact is primarily the result of the influence of both sides’ assessments of each other’s intentions, motivations, and capabilities to use AI technologies, a process that is influenced by three factors: the characteristics of AI technologies themselves at the technical level, the state’s sense of tension and security at the cognitive level, and the normative role of the AI rule system at the institutional level. This essay first reviews relevant studies on AI and U.S.–China strategic mutual trust, as well as the different analytical perspectives of realism, neoliberalism, and constructivism on the impact of uncertainty on strategic mutual trust between countries, and then analyses the risk of MUAI as a kind of uncertainty and its potential impact paths on U.S.–China strategic mutual trust at three levels: technical, cognitive, and institutional. Finally, on this basis, we propose suggestions on how to manage and prevent differences and conflicts arising from the risk of MUAI technologies and how to develop strategic mutual trust between China and the United States.","2023","2025-07-17 09:45:44","2025-07-17 09:45:44","2025-07-17 09:45:42","377-396","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-22552-9_14","","","","","","Pashentsev, Evgeny","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The focus of this chapter is emotion-driven artificial intelligence (AI), and, therefore, attention is devoted mainly to affective computing and sentiment analysis. Affective computing as a research field and technological domain enables the recognition and simulation of human emotions in various inputs. Sentiment analysis is a method that entails the use of machine learning to recognize emotional and subjective meanings. Both approaches are applied to identify hate speech on social media. Yet, even though there are many positive consequences (e.g., automatic detection of misinformation and harmful content), the further development of AI might also become instrumental in perception management campaigns targeted at a particular audience. This chapter aims to identify a general scenario for the MUAI in the spread of hate speech, estimate the interdependence of social and technical factors of such scenario, and specify possible solutions to combat this threat. To this end, the chapter is based on scenario analysis and includes an assessment of existing examples, risks, and counteractions related to the threat of MUAI in the dissemination of hate speech.","2023","2025-07-17 09:45:44","2025-07-17 09:45:44","2025-07-17 09:45:42","105-132","","","","","","Hate Speech in Perception Management Campaigns","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-22552-9_5","","","","","","Pashentsev, Evgeny","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a dependency model tailored in context toward current challenges in data strategies and make recommendations for the cybersecurity community. The model can be used for cyber risk estimation and assessment and generic risk impact assessment. The model is developed for cyber risk insurance for new technologies (e.g., drones, robots). Still, practitioners can apply it to estimate and assess cyber risks in organizations and enterprises. Furthermore, this paper critically discusses why risk assessment and management are crucial in this domain and what open questions on IoT risk assessment and risk management remain areas for further research. The paper then presents a more holistic understanding of cyber risks in the IoT. We explain how the industry can use new risk assessment, and management approaches to deal with the challenges posed by emerging IoT cyber risks.

Systems often fail because the organizations that defend them do not bear the full costs of failure. For instance, companies operating critical infrastructures have integrated control systems with the Internet to reduce near-term, measurable costs while raising the risk of catastrophic failures, whose losses will be primarily borne by society. As long as anti-virus software is left to individuals to purchase and install, there may be a less than optimal level of protection when infected machines cause trouble for other machines rather than their owners. In order to solve the problems of growing vulnerability and increasing crime, policy and legislation must coherently allocate responsibilities and liabilities so that the parties in a position to fix problems have an incentive to do so.

"AJWKBVC4","journalArticle","","Cordes, Joseph J","An Overview of the Economics of Cybersecurity and Cybersecurity Policy","","","","","","The design of effective policies to enhance and maintain cyber security must take into account a complex set of incentives facing not only the providers and users of the internet and computer software, but also those of potential attackers. Measures undertaken to defend against attacks must take into account that, like other forms of criminal and terrorist activity, the attackers are not passive agents (unlike nature in the case of natural hazards), and the design of effective policies must recognize, to the extent possible, that the defensive measures will elicit strategic responses from the attacker. There also are potentially serious incentive issues arising from classical problems of externalities and public good problems that encourage underinvestment in cyber security by private parties (e.g. businesses and software developers). Lastly, reducing the probability of cyber attacks and/or the consequences of cyber attacks is not costless. In principle, well-designed policies should balance benefits from defensive measures against their costs (which include important concerns about privacy). The paper examines how these questions can be addressed using fairly standard principles and tools from economic policy analysis and potential policy research questions.","","2025-07-17 09:47:23","2025-07-17 09:47:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\6AYXD5X8\Cordes - An Overview of the Economics of Cybersecurity and Cybersecurity Policy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"SY2RKYJP","journalArticle","","Moore, Tyler","Introducing the Economics of Cybersecurity: Principles and Policy Options","","","","","","The economics of information security has recently become a thriving and fast-moving discipline. Systems often fail because the organizations that defend them do not bear the full costs of failure. For instance, companies operating critical infrastructures have integrated control systems with the Internet to reduce near-term, measurable costs while raising the risk of catastrophic failure, whose losses will be primarily borne by society. So long as anti-virus software is left to individuals to purchase and install, there may be a less than optimal level of protection when infected machines cause trouble for other machines rather than their owners. In order to solve the problems of growing vulnerability and increasing crime, policy and legislation must coherently allocate responsibilities and liabilities so that the parties in a position to fix problems have an incentive to do so. In this paper, we outline in greater detail the various challenges plaguing cybersecurity: misaligned incentives, information asymmetries and externalities. We then discuss the regulatory options that are available to overcome these economic barriers in the cybersecurity context: ex ante safety regulation, ex post liability, information disclosure, and indirect intermediary liability. Finally, we make several recommendations for policy changes to improve cybersecurity: mitigating malware infections via ISPs by subsidized cleanup, mandatory disclosure of fraud losses and security incidents, mandatory disclosure of control system incidents and intrusions, and aggregating reports of cyber espionage and reporting to the WTO.","","2025-07-17 09:47:35","2025-07-17 09:47:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\UAT26RGR\Moore - Introducing the Economics of Cybersecurity Principles and Policy Options.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Deciding how and whether to invest in cybersecurity protection requires knowing the answer to at least two questions: What is the likelihood of an attack, and what are its likely consequences? Security analysts understand a system's vulnerability to potential cyberattacks fairly well, but to date, research on the economic consequences of cyberattacks has been limited, dealing primarily with microanalyses of attacks' direct impacts on a particular organization. Many managers recognize the significant potential of a cyberattack's effects to cascade from one computer or business system to another, but there have been no significant efforts to develop a methodology to account for both direct and indirect costs. Without such a methodology, project managers and their organizations are hard pressed to make informed decisions about how much to invest in cybersecurity and how to ensure that security resources are used effectively. In this article, we explore how others have sought answers to our two questions. We describe the data available to inform decisions about investing in cybersecurity and look at research models of the trade-offs between investment and protection.

The ultimate source is that computer owners lack adequate incentives to invest in security because they bear fully the costs of their security precautions but share the benefits with their network partners. In a world of positive transaction costs, individuals often select less than optimal security levels. The problem is compounded because the insecure networks extend far beyond the regulatory jurisdiction of any one nation or even coalition of nations. This book brings together the views of leading law and economics scholars on the nature of the cybersecurity problem and possible solutions to it. Many of these solutions are market based, but they need some help, either from government or industry groups or both.

As these countries strive to harness the power of modern technology to drive economic growth, enhance public services, and elevate living standards, they concurrently face heightened risks associated with cyber threats. The increasing exposure of developing countries to cyber incidents is often compounded by various factors, including scarce resources, inadequate infrastructure, political unrest, inefficiencies in cybersecurity and technology markets, shortages of skilled cybersecurity professionals, legislative voids, and rapid rates of digital adoption. Cybersecurity Economics for Emerging Markets is a pioneering research work that delves into the drivers and profound consequences of cyber incidents worldwide. From economic setbacks that can destabilize entire economies to interruptions of vital services and impediments to social and economic development, the impacts of cyber incidents are far-reaching. This book analyzes hundreds of scholarly works and thousands of publicly disclosed cyber incidents over the past decade across some 190 countries. It sheds light on these incidents’ characteristics and trends, as well as the proactive roles that private market players and governments can assume to safeguard infrastructure in cyberspace effectively. The book presents practical, evidence-based policy suggestions that include efforts to strengthen the resilience of the most essential and interconnected sectors. It advocates for bolstering the national cybersecurity industries, strategizing cybersecurity research and development, addressing market failures through cybersecurity awareness and training programs, and taking proactive steps to reduce and control contagion effects from cyber incidents. By revealing crucial empirical and theoretical dimensions of cybersecurity economics, this book provides insights that could inform the creation of effective cybersecurity investments, with a focus on developing countries. These insights are invaluable for policy makers and stakeholders committed to fortifying the digital ecosystem against the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats.","2024-10-16","2025-07-17 09:59:28","2025-07-17 09:59:28","","","123","","","","","","","","","","World Bank Publications","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: BfFiEQAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.com.au/books?id=BfFiEQAAQBAJ","","Business & Economics / Development / Economic Development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We posit that by focusing almost exclusively on targeted firms, researchers ignore a material component of CSB-related costs. This narrow perspective leads to an apparent rift between the active regulatory and media concern about CSBs on one hand and observed general lack of response by capital markets on the other. Adopting a broad-based, multi-faceted approach, we examine the effect of CSBs on non-breached industry peers through the lens of capital markets, auditors, and affected insurers. We find that non-breached peers experience significant negative equity returns around the announcement of a CSB in their industry, together with a material increase in audit fees during the year of the infraction. We also document significantly negative equity returns for insurers with material cybersecurity exposure. Our results reinforce the importance of considering the implications of an economic event beyond the targeted entity and offer a lower bound estimate of CSB costs.","","2025-07-17 10:05:07","2025-07-17 10:05:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\QY9V2PYY\Haislip et al. - The economic cost of cybersecurity breaches A broad-based analysis.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, today technologists pursuing interesting and elegant solutions have little knowledge of the feasibility for broad deployment of their results and cannot anticipate the influences of other technologies, existing infrastructure, and technology evolution, nor bring the solutions lifecycle into the equation. Additionally, potentially viable solutions are not adopted because the risk perceptions by potential providers and users far outweighs the economic incentives to support introduction/adoption of new best practices and technologies that are not well enough defined.

Assuring the integrity of today's missions, and the highly networked systems they depend on, requires economic decisions in rapidly changing technology and cyber threat environments. Knowing that countermeasures effective against today's threats can be ineffective tomorrow, decision-makers need agile ways to assess the efficacies of investments in cyber security on assuring mission outcomes. Analytical methods in cyber security economics need to be flexible in their information demands. Some investment decisions may necessitate methods that use in-depth knowledge about a mission's information systems and networks, vulnerabilities, and adversary abilities to exploit weaknesses. Other investment decisions may necessitate methods that use only a high-level understanding of these dimensions. The sophistication of methods to conduct economic-benefit tradeoffs of mission assuring investments must calibrate to the range of knowledge environments present within an organization. This paper presents a family of analytical frameworks to assess and measure the effectiveness of cyber security and the economic-benefit tradeoffs of competing cyber security investments. These frameworks demonstrate ways to think through and shape an analysis of the economic-benefit returns on cyber security investments - rather than being viewed as rigid model structures.","2014-10","2025-07-17 10:05:45","2025-07-17 10:05:45","2025-07-17 10:05:45","136-145","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2155-7586","","","","","Accuracy; Computer security; cyber mission assurance; cybersecurity; cybersecurity economics; cybersecurity risk; economic-benefit tradeoffs; Economics; Investment; Measurement; mission effectiveness; Organizations; Portfolios","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2014 IEEE Military Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A comprehensive matrix of cybersecurity economic assessment based on threats, motives, impacts, challenges and economic impacts is provided in this paper. Cybersecurity risk quantification and their measurement and Cyber risk mitigation frameworks are also dealt with in this paper. Our cybersecurity risk Return On Security Investment (ROSI) model employs 9-parameters, while our dataset collection is classified into 11 types of attack profiles. The results obtained from Naïve Bayes classifier and CRQ using J48 bagging tree model yield a predictor accuracy of 82%, while the classifier correctly classifies instances in Naïve Bayes with a Receiver-Operator-Characteristic (ROC) area of 0.940 indicating the good classification of the sampled data; the prediction rate is 94.2% for the CRQ-J48. The ROC curve for the naïve Bayes classifier performs its best when the data is at 80% and performs worse when at 10%. Similarly, the J48 performs best when the data is at 85%-90% and worse between 5%-10%. While examining the cost of the data breach of a single instance of compromise, it can be estimated that web server has the maximum exposure and hence the cost of a breach is approximately estimated to be around 19 million dollars in our dataset.","2021-02","2025-07-17 10:05:50","2025-07-17 10:05:50","2025-07-17 10:05:50","530-537","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","","","","Analytical models; Asset and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE); Bagging; Computer security; Cyber Value at Risk (CyVar); Cybersecurity; Cyberspace; Data models; Deep learning; Deep Learning Techniques - Naïve Bayes algorithm & J48 bagging tree model; Economic Risks and; Economics; Factor Analysis of Information Risk Institute (FAIR); Operationally Critical Threat; Power generation; Virtual Power Plant (VPP)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 7th International Conference on Electrical Energy Systems (ICEES)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advanced computing technologies, ubiquitous environments, and sophisticated networks enable globally distributed access to data and information repositories to an uncountable community of consumers. Engineering security into these systems is more challenging and sophisticated than ever before. Along with this, assuring the integrity of highly networked systems requires economic decisions in rapidly changing technology and threat environments. Recognizing that countermeasures effective against cyber intrusions today can be ineffective tomorrow, the systems engineering community needs a rapid and agile way to identify the efficacies of competing countermeasure investment decisions. This paper presents a macroanalytic method for measuring economic-benefit returns on investments in cybersecurity. The method is called the Table Top Approach. The table top approach is designed to place light demands on the granularity of inputs to evaluate the impacts of cyber intrusion events and the benefits of countermeasure investments. The table top approach derives which investments in a set of competing choices offer the greatest cost-benefit gains in cyber defense, and why. It finds sets of Pareto efficient cost-benefit investments, and their economic returns, that capture tangible and intangible advantages of countermeasures that strengthen cybersecurity. ©2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Additionally, we introduce the concepts of “bookkeeping” and “abstraction” within the context of simulations, discussing how they can sometimes fail and exploring the underlying reasons for their failures. This discussion leads us to suggest a framework of considerations for effectively utilizing simulations in cybersecurity. This framework is designed not as a rigid checklist but as a guide for critical thinking and evaluation, aiding users in assessing the suitability and reliability of a simulation model for a particular decision-making context.

The involved coefficients have been estimated to cast reservation on growth account approach results produced that ignored variables’ parameter estimation that reveals the consistency of the results produced in the first step. On the other hand, in the second step, the modified model calculates productivity indicators ignored by econometric approach studies. The doubt on the results generated by both approaches has been overcame via developing the combined models into two steps growth accounting approach that provides parametric solutions and econometric approach gap that has been filled in the second step that calculates productivity indicators.

Ineffective cybersecurity measures pose serious threats and risks to the development and stability of information societies in the world. Various doctrines and thesis explore how this domain should be treated by the public and private stakeholders. One of these doctrines is cybersecurity as a public good. In this paper, we highlight divergent views about the type of cybersecurity as an economic good. Then, the paper proposes an agent-based simulation model of a repeated public goods game among a set of defenders that are in an uncertain environment with incomplete and imperfect information. In the model, defenders have a probability to choose contribution or being a free-rider, depending on their own preferences and facing with revealed preferences of other defenders. This model implements a utility maximization that applies to each individual, modeling the existence of free-riders, punishments, and interdependency of decisions under a polycentric governance structure. The results of this simulation model show that, over time, defenders update their preferences in reaction to the behavior of other defenders and the experience of cyber-attacks. They indicate a high level of contribution to the provision of cybersecurity as a public good and the effectiveness of decentralized punishment on increasing the contributions. The consistency of the pattern of our results across different empirical studies lends us some reassurance that our model behavior is in quantitative agreement with empirical macro-structures. Furthermore, implementation of a polycentric structure challenges all the relevant agents to take action, and provides more robust environment.","2022-04-01","2025-07-17 10:06:52","2025-07-17 10:06:52","2025-07-17 10:06:52","102493","","","116","","Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\RHUANKPR\Kianpour et al. - 2022 - Advancing the concept of cybersecurity as a public good.pdf; C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\343XEJQI\S1569190X22000053.html","","","Agent-based modeling; Collective actions; Cybersecurity economics; Heterogeneous preferences; Polycentric governance structure; Public goods; Social preferences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this article is to explain the absence of serious adverse consequences to date and the durability of this trend.,This paper combines concepts from international relations theory and new institutional economics to understand cyberspace as a complex global institution with contracts embodied in both software code and human practice. Constitutive inefficiencies (market and regulatory failure) and incomplete contracts (generative features and unintended flaws) create the vulnerabilities that hackers exploit. Cyber conflict is a form of cheating within the rules, rather than an anarchic struggle, more like an intelligence-counterintelligence contest than traditional war.,Cyber conflict is restrained by the collective sociotechnical constitution of cyberspace, where actors must cooperate to compete. Maintenance of common protocols and open access is a condition for the possibility of attack, and successful deceptive exploitation of these connections becomes more difficult in politically sensitive situations as defense and deterrence become more feasible. The distribution of cyber conflict is, thus, bounded vertically in severity but unbounded horizontally in the potential for creative exploitation.,Cyber conflict can be understood with familiar political economic concepts applied in fresh ways. This application provides counterintuitive insights at odds with prevalent threat narratives about the likelihood and magnitude of cyber conflict. It also highlights the important advantages of strong states over the weaker non-state actors widely thought to be empowered by cyberspace.","2017-09-11","2025-07-17 10:07:40","2025-07-17 10:07:40","2025-07-17 10:07:40","493-514","","6","19","","","Restrained by design","","","","","","","en","","","","world","www.emerald.com","","Publisher: Emerald Publishing Limited","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By examining 240 SMEs across the UK, the empirical findings of this investigation underscore its classification as a merit-good due to its extensive social benefits and the critical gap in its optimal provision. The results confirm the existence of market failure, such as the lack and asymmetry of information regarding cybersecurity, acknowledging the myopia and lack of information within SMEs, leading to suboptimal implementation of cybersecurity. Moreover, the lack of optimal implementation is evidenced by the findings indicating that neither cybersecurity incidents nor cybersecurity impacts in SMEs drive the implementation of cybersecurity. Additionally, we observe that implementation is more focused on control systems than on management systems, which is a significant differentiating factor from large enterprises. The study contributes theoretically by framing cybersecurity as a merit-good, provides managerial insights into SME cybersecurity practices, and emphasizes the importance of nuanced policies to bridge the implementation gap.","2024-09-01","2025-07-17 10:07:49","2025-07-17 10:07:49","2025-07-17 10:07:49","102670","","","78","","Technology in Society","Exploring the economic role of cybersecurity in SMEs","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Cybersecurity; Cybersecurity control; Cybersecurity incidents; Cybersecurity management; Merit-good; SME","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper examines the impact of socioeconomic development indicators, in particular gross national income, spending and remittances, literacy and unemployment, on the dynamics of cybercrime worldwide, and analyses trends in public awareness and involvement in criminal activity in the digital space. The methodological tools of the study are the methods of correlation and canonical analysis, implemented in the Statistica 12 software. The analysis of the relationship between the socio-economic conditions of society and cybercrime-related behaviour established a dual impact of these factors on vulnerability to cybercrime and participation in criminal activity as a way of income generation. On the one hand, socioeconomic disparities, in particular income inequality and unemployment, contribute to the increasing vulnerability of society to cybercrime. On the other hand, a high level of poverty among the population motivates a certain part of it to participate in cybercriminal activities. The results of the study indicate that socio-economic inequality and unemployment play a critical role in managing cybercrime risks. A higher level of economic development and social security is accompanied by greater resilience to cyberthreats, while a high level of unemployment and significant economic inequality increase the vulnerability of society to such risks. The findings also revealed that the socio-economic development of the country largely depends on the level of its cybercrime. This highlights the need to integrate cybersecurity measures into national economic development strategies. The practical significance of the obtained results lies in the application of a comprehensive approach to understanding cybercrime, which considers both victimization and active participation of society in this activity. This study can serve as a basis for the development of targeted measures to prevent cybercrime and increase the resilience of society to cyberthreats. The findings highlight the importance of integrating economic and social components in the development of effective cybersecurity strategies, which will contribute to minimizing the risks associated with the use of digital space and strengthening the socio-economic stability of the country.","2024","2025-07-17 10:07:56","2025-07-17 10:07:56","2025-07-17 10:07:56","127-140","","4","15","","MMI","Innovative Approaches to Ensuring Cybersecurity and Public Safety","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","Publisher: Sumy State University","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\TXUHA79U\Tiutiunyk et al. - 2024 - Innovative Approaches to Ensuring Cybersecurity and Public Safety The Socio-Economic Dimension.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The nation is a hierarchical system as it consists multiple classes of decisionmakers and stakeholders ranging from national policymakers to operators of specific critical infrastructure subsystems. Critical infrastructures (e.g., transportation, telecommunications, power, banking, etc.) are highly complex and interconnected. These interconnections take the form of flows of information, shared security, and physical flows of commodities, among others. In recent years, economic and infrastructure sectors have become increasingly dependent on networked information systems for efficient operations and timely delivery of products and services. In order to ensure the stability, sustainability, and operability of our critical economic and infrastructure sectors, it is imperative to understand their inherent physical and economic linkages, in addition to their cyber interdependencies. An interdependency model based on a transformation of the Leontief input-output (I-O) model can be used for modeling: (1) the steady-state economic effects triggered by a consumption shift in a given sector (or set of sectors); and (2) the resulting ripple effects to other sectors. The inoperability metric is calculated for each sector; this is achieved by converting the economic impact (typically in monetary units) into a percentage value relative to the size of the sector. Disruptive events such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and large-scale accidents have historically shown cascading effects on both consumption and production. Hence, a dynamic model extension is necessary to demonstrate the interplay between combined demand and supply effects. The result is a foundational framework for modeling cybersecurity scenarios for the oil and gas sector.

Therefore, investment in cybersecurity is an important financial and operational decision. Typical information technology investments aim to create value, whereas cybersecurity investments aim to minimize loss incurred by cyber attacks. Admittedly, cybersecurity investment has become an increasingly complex one, since information systems are typically subject to frequent attacks, whose arrival and impact fluctuate stochastically. Furthermore, cybersecurity measures and improvements, such as patches, become available at random points in time making investment decisions even more challenging. We propose and develop an analytical real options framework that incorporates major components relevant to cybersecurity practice, and analyze how optimal cybersecurity investment decisions perform for a private firm. The novelty of this paper is that it provides analytical solutions that lend themselves to intuitive interpretations regarding the effect of timing and cybersecurity risk on investment behavior using real options theory. Such aspects are frequently not implemented within economic models that support policy initiatives. However, if these are not properly understood, security controls will not be properly set resulting in a dynamic inefficiency reflected in cycles of over or under investment, and, in turn, increased cybersecurity risk following corrective policy actions. Results indicate that greater uncertainty over the cost of cybersecurity attacks raises the value of an embedded option to invest in cybersecurity. This increases the incentive to suspend operations temporarily in order to install a cybersecurity patch that will make the firm more resilient to cybersecurity breaches. Similarly, greater likelihood associated with the availability of a cybersecurity patch increases the value of the option to invest in cybersecurity. However, the absence of an embedded investment option increases the incentive to delay the permanent abandonment of the company's operation due to the irreversible nature of the decision.","2018","2025-07-17 10:08:52","2025-07-17 10:08:52","2025-07-17 10:08:52","12175-12186","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\LAHWR7CY\Chronopoulos et al. - 2018 - An Options Approach to Cybersecurity Investment.pdf","","","Cybersecurity; Investment; investment analysis; Organizations; real options; Timing; Uncertainty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A data comparison algorithm is considered, which consists in continuous monitoring and scanning of data by constantly comparing data with information patterns of users and services, as well as threat patterns and indicators based on previous experience, not only one's own, within a local network or system, but also globally scale An improved method of rapid data comparison is presented, which provides maximum accuracy of comparison with a minimum amount of equipment for comparing devices. Its use makes it possible to identify potential cyber threats and take preventive measures, which will increase the level of protection of critical infrastructure objects.Chapter 2 focuses on defining strategic directions for ensuring economic cyber security of business in Ukraine. The importance of information protection in the context of the development of the digital economy has been updated, and the place of economic cyber security in the national security system has been determined. A thorough analysis of the dynamics of cyber incidents in the world in recent years was carried out and the specifics of the manifestation of cyber threats at the macro and micro levels were outlined. Special attention is paid to the intrusion detection process and a detailed study of the working principles of modern intrusion detection and prevention systems. It is expected that the use of the proposed recommendations on the cyber security policy will significantly increase the level of information security (confidentiality, integrity and availability) of the business.Chapter 3 is dedicated to solving the problem of strengthening the security of strategically important enterprises of Ukraine by developing effective forms of implementation of the state regulatory policy in this direction. The issue of identifying strategically important enterprises and forming their security at the state level as a basis for supporting and restoring the national economy has been updated. The strategic directions of deregulation of business activity in Ukraine, including strategically important enterprises, have been determined. One of them is institutional support of state regulatory policy, improvement of regulatory policy. On the basis of the analysis of the existing institutional support of the state regulatory policy regarding strategically important enterprises, it has been proved that the basis of the formation of effective forms of implementation of the state regulatory policy of support and strengthening of the security of strategically important enterprises is the need to improve the current legislation, the formation of effective institutional and organizational support and the clustering of the national economy based on strategic important enterprises with the possibility of creating integrated corporate structures. A model of the process of assessing the effectiveness of the implementation of the state regulatory policy on ensuring the security of strategically important enterprises is proposed, which provides regulatory bodies with a tool to influence its level with the provision of economic development and social stability in Ukraine.Chapter 4 explores Semantic role labeling (SRL) as a key Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that plays a vital role in extracting meaningful information from text. The role of SRL and its application is considered in the context of economics and cyber security, because the accurate definition and analysis of semantic roles in text is critical due to the rapid increase in the amount and complexity of textual information. State-of-the-art NLP classifiers used in decision-making, market analysis and financial reports, media articles, and economic texts are reviewed. It is emphasized that the process of determining relevant information from a large array of data collected from disparate sources requires an optimal methodological base, which should include the use of special tools for cleaning, tokenization, marking parts of speech with labels for preparation for NLP analysis. With the help of NLP classifiers, it becomes possible to automatically identify data, which allows to get information about market trends or security threats, depending on the specific field. It is noted that the proposed methods are practically significant, as they improve the ability to extract useful information, assess risks and make informed decisions by organizing unstructured textual data.Chapter 5 is dedicated to the comprehensive substantiation of the theoretical and methodological foundations and practical methods of monitoring the state of financial security of Ukraine in conditions of economic turbulence as a factor ensuring the preservation of the state's financial system. Indicators of the state of financial security of regions are proposed and it is proved that they are not strongly connected, and also interconnected with the state of financial security of the state, which allows their use as input information in the process of calculating the integral indicator of the state of financial security of the region. On the basis of the proposed methodology for assessing the state of financial security of regions, integral indicators of the state of financial security of regions of Ukraine were calculated, which are actually the result of collapsing indicators by subsystems into a system index for a certain region, high values of which characterize a relatively stable value of financial security of a certain region, and low values signal its dangerous or critical condition.Chapter 6 discusses the essence and features of the circular economy as an innovative com-ponent of the modern economy, which functions and develops on the basis of sustainable devel-opment, the deep reasons for its emergence, formation and transformation into a factor in the formation of a new paradigm of the global economy. Being a mechanism for the implementation of the Global Goals of sustainable development, the concept of a closed cycle economy encourages highly deve loped countries and businesses to introduce innovations and define the development of a circular economy as a priority in their long-term strategies.The monograph is intended for researchers who are engaged in the development of measures to increase the financial security of the state, primarily through the development or improvement of security systems in cyberspace, as well as practitioners who are looking for the best scientific solutions for implementation, which can contribute to the formation of reliable cyber protection measures in the information environment of the enterprise, contributing to the increase of its financial security.The monograph is also useful for state authorities, which are forced to search for operational, most effective solutions to ensure the financial security of the state as a whole, its strategic enterprises, including critical infrastructure, in particular through the regulation of security measures in the information space, in the presence of modern external threats.","2023-11-24","2025-07-17 10:09:43","2025-07-17 10:09:43","2025-07-17 10:09:43","","","","","","","","","","","","TECHNOLOGY CENTER PC","Kharkiv, Ukraine","en","","","","","Crossref","","DOI: 10.15587/978-617-7319-98-5","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\I8RRS8V7\2023 - ECONOMIC AND CYBER SECURITY.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cybersecurity researchers have been acutely aware of this challenge for many years, and it led them to look for solutions to bridge the gap between their empirical data and macro-level realities. In the early 2000s, economic models, or in general economics language, were hailed to explain, predict, and manage many cybersecurity problems more clearly and convincingly. Over the past two decades, the close collaboration between cybersecurity economics researchers and economists, sociologists, lawyers, politicians, and psychologists led to tremendous advances towards attaining these goals. This collaboration enabled us to identify, collect, and interpret existing and emerging issues that could impact the cybersecurity posture of agents operating at different levels of open, complex socio-technical systems. However, recent findings indicate that cybersecurity economists still struggle to factor in various issues, such as human and institutional governance and dominance structures, complexity and uncertainty of the digital ecosystems, and the rapidly changing dimensions of cybersecurity issues, to suggest practical and sustainable solutions. These issues have made various challenges in theory and practice of cybersecurity economics that hinder the proposed solutions within this field to be embedded in social norms and institutions that promote secure behavior in digital ecosystems. After identification of these challenges, this research project explores and advocates multi-paradigmatic approaches to tackle the theoretical challenges in cybersecurity economics research. We argue that these approaches provide appealing theoretical and practical frameworks. to understand and interpret known and unknown cybersecurity problems. Regarding the practical challenges, however, this thesis supports the notion of cybersecurity as a public good. Although this notion has been proposed repeatedly by scholars, it has not been substantiated by qualitative and quantitative analysis and studies. Therefore, in this thesis, we take up the challenge of employing a range of paradigms including functionalism, constructivism, and critical realism within one research investigation: cybersecurity as a public good. This thesis outlines a research project in which several studies were conducted to investigate this topic from perspectives of individuals, groups, and institutions. Results were obtained through using theories and methods from multiple paradigms as the basis for research. In seven research papers, details of the studies are given, research findings are presented, and the validity of the methods is discussed. Following transdisciplinary research strategy that supports co-creation of knowledge by participatory inclusion of scientific and societal actors, this research project suggests gamification and policy games to re-integrate knowledge and provide an essential context for understanding some of the most important, complex, and difficult issues both scientific and societal actors face.

All actors in the widening ecology of the Internet require a better social and cultural understanding of cybersecurity issues in order to effectively engage all relevant stakeholders in processes aimed at enhancing cybersecurity. The problems tied to cybersecurity are not new, but as the Internet becomes ever more essential to everyday life and work, and empowers users as never before, there are new social and economic aspects of the challenges to achieving a secure, open and global Internet that require much more focused attention. For years, computer scientists and engineers have recognized that cybersecurity is not merely an engineering and computer science problem, but also an economic and behavioral challenge. But recognition of the fact that cybersecurity cannot be successfully addressed with technical solutions alone, is not sufficient. It is critical that economists and other social and behavioral scientists engage in this area and address the practices of a wider range of actors in local and global arenas who need strategies that provide feasible and practical steps for securing the Internet and the incentives and mindsets to take them.","2015-06-04","2025-07-17 10:16:51","2025-07-17 10:16:51","2025-07-17 10:16:51","","","","","","","The New Cybersecurity Agenda","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","","","","","","communication; cybercrime; cybersecurity; information; Internet; security; technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2614545","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interdependency of assets poses an additional challenge to make decisions on investments for the cyber domain. Therefore, organizations need to answer hard questions: whether, how much, and when to invest in cybersecurity. Analyzing the attack surface of a system or an enterprise in cyberspace, prioritizing assets according to their business values, and quantifying cybersecurity risk in monetary values would help to make better decisions while choosing a risk management strategy.

However, the academic understanding regarding different incentives for these investments are fragmented throughout many different studies and a clear overview of these types of incentives for cybersecurity is lacking. This research aims to fill this deficiency by providing clarity on how incentives can be conceptualised, and what they mean in the context of investing and managing cybersecurity. This article provides a typology of cybersecurity incentives of organisations that can be used by scholars and professionals to understand the (lack of) adoption of cybersecurity measures. The typology is developed on the basis of a literature study encompassing different theoretical perspectives on incentives, and illustrated and further scrutinised with an empirical case about the adoption of secure e-mail standards. We present a typology of six categories of incentives that may explain why organisations are (not) willing to invest in cybersecurity measures: economic-, normative-, historic- and feasibility incentives, network externalities, and the presence of competing cybersecurity issues and solutions. This typology can serve as a starting point for future research to develop a (full) conceptual framework for identifying and understanding incentives for cybersecurity. Furthermore, cybersecurity professionals (e.g. Chief Information Security Officers) and policy makers can use this typology in their work to enhance the cybersecurity of organisations and society.","2021-10-01","2025-07-17 10:17:48","2025-07-17 10:17:48","2025-07-17 10:17:48","100014","","2","1","","Digital Business","Understanding incentives for cybersecurity investments","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Case study; Cybersecurity; Incentives typology; Policy support","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A cyber-attack on the United States would involve complex strategic behavior by terrorists, who could invade an airport electronic system without any U.S. border or entry point. At the same time, defending entities must consider the complex processes that may cause any turmoil. The possibility of simultaneous threats from cyber-attacks makes it more difficult for defending entities to secure their airports, highlighting the need for improved and integrated inter-governmental collaboration. Collaborative networking requires close inter-governmental coordination to overcome such cyber-terrorism to protect critical infrastructure systems. Constructing a new model for strategic cyber-terror security requires a combination of competitive and cooperative game situations to develop specific strategies against cyber-terrorism. In addition, an airport shutdown would have ripple effects throughout domestic and international economies; these effects must be analyzed with a spatially disaggregate economic model. Combining competitive and cooperative game situations with an economic impact model, this study proposes the Game Theoretic National Interstate Economic Model (G-NIEMO) framework. G-NIEMO identifies which airport may be most vulnerable in the event that an airport electronic system is shut down. Using the probabilistic costs of airport closures, the model identifies the economic importance of cyber security by event location and industry type. From G-NIEMO, equilibrium strategies to protect U.S. airport systems can be developed and a general guideline for the evaluation of resource allocation can be provided to U.S. government agencies.","2018","2025-07-17 10:18:10","2025-07-17 10:18:10","2025-07-17 10:18:10","317-339","","","","","","Advances in Cybersecurity Design","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-78021-4_15","","","","","","Masys, Anthony J.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An insightful aspect of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is its explicit recognition that the activities associated with managing cybersecurity risk are organization specific. The NIST Framework also recognizes that organizations should evaluate their cybersecurity risk management on a cost–benefit basis. The NIST Framework, however, does not provide guidance on how to carry out such a cost–benefit analysis. This article provides an approach for integrating cost–benefit analysis into the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The Gordon–Loeb (GL) Model for cybersecurity investments is proposed as a basis for deriving a cost-effective level of spending on cybersecurity activities and for selecting the appropriate NIST Implementation Tier level. The analysis shows that the GL Model provides a logical approach to use when considering the cost–benefit aspects of cybersecurity investments during an organization’s process of selecting the most appropriate NIST Implementation Tier level. In addition, the cost–benefit approach provided in this article helps to identify conditions under which there is an incentive to move to a higher NIST Implementation Tier.","2020-01-01","2025-07-17 10:20:18","2025-07-17 10:20:18","2025-07-17 10:20:18","tyaa005","","1","6","","Journal of Cybersecurity","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\KHRP5ALD\Gordon et al. - 2020 - Integrating cost–benefit analysis into the NIST Cybersecurity Framework via the Gordon–Loeb Model.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we survey 24 articles from 2008 to 2018 that use game theory to model defensive deception for cybersecurity and privacy. Then, we propose a taxonomy that defines six types of deception: perturbation, moving target defense, obfuscation, mixing, honey-x, and attacker engagement. These types are delineated by their information structures, agents, actions, and duration: precisely concepts captured by game theory. Our aims are to rigorously define types of defensive deception, to capture a snapshot of the state of the literature, to provide a menu of models that can be used for applied research, and to identify promising areas for future work.

Because of the imperfect performance of automated detection techniques, responses to such attacks are highly dependent on human-driven decision-making processes. While game theory has been applied to many problems that require rational decisionmaking, we find limitation on applying such method on security games when the defender has limited information about the opponent's strategies and payoffs. In this work, we propose Q-Learning to react automatically to the adversarial behavior of a suspicious user to secure the system.

Since financial resources for investment in security are limited, optimal allocation of these cybersecurity resources in the grid is extremely important. At the same time, optimization of these investments proves to be challenging due to the uncertain behavior of attackers and the dynamically changing threat landscape. Existing solutions for this problem either do not address the dynamic behavior of adversaries or lack in the practical feasibility of the defense models. This paper addresses the problem of optimizing investment strategies in the cybersecurity infrastructure of a smart grid using a game-theoretic approach. The attacker is modeled using various attacker profiles which represent the possible types of adversaries in the context of CPS. Each profile has certain characteristics to bring out the aspect of uncertain behavior of the adversaries. The defender is modeled with various pragmatic characteristics that can be easily translated to the real-world grid scenarios for implementation. These characteristics include the standards laid down by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) commonly known as the NERC-CIP standards. The game-theoretic framework allows us to obtain optimal strategies that the defender of the grid can adopt to minimize its losses against the possible attack threats on the grid. The concept is illustrated by a simplistic 3-bus power system model case study which depicts how the solution can be translated to practical implementation in the actual grid.","2020-02","2025-07-17 11:43:55","2025-07-17 11:43:55","2025-07-17 11:43:55","1-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2472-8152","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\R5ER5WEH\9087634.html","","","Attacker model; CPS; Cybersecurity; Defender model; Game Theory; NERC-CIP; Smart Grid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cybersecurity is a pressing issue in the manufacturing sector. Nevertheless, managing the risk in cybersecurity has become a critical challenge for modern manufacturing enterprises. In risk management thinking, the first step is to identify the risk, then validate it, and lastly, consider responses to the risk. If the risk is below the security risk appetite of the manufacturing system, it could be accepted. However, if it is above the risk appetite, the system should appropriately respond by either avoiding, transferring, or mitigating the risk. The validation of the risk in terms of severity and likelihood of the threat, however, is challenging because the later component is hard to quantify. In this paper, Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method is modified by employing game theory to quantitatively assess the likelihood of cyber-physical security risks. This method utilizes the game theory approach by modeling the rivalry between the attacker and the system as a game and then try to analyze it to find the likelihood of the attacker’s action. We first define players of the game, action sets, and the utility function. Major concerns of cyber security issues in the manufacturing area are carefully considered in defining the cost function composed of defense policy, loss in production, and recovery. A linear optimization model is utilized to find a mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium, which is the probability of choosing any action by the attacker also known as the likelihood of an attack. Numerical experiments are presented to further illustrate the method. Forecasting the attacker’s behavior enables us to assess the cybersecurity risk in a manufacturing system and thereby be more prepared with plans of proper responses.","2019-01-01","2025-07-17 11:44:35","2025-07-17 11:44:35","2025-07-17 11:44:35","605-612","","","38","","Procedia Manufacturing","Risk Assessment for Cyber Security of Manufacturing Systems","29th International Conference on Flexible Automation and Intelligent Manufacturing ( FAIM 2019), June 24-28, 2019, Limerick, Ireland, Beyond Industry 4.0: Industrial Advances, Engineering Education and Intelligent Manufacturing","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Cybersecurity in Manufacturing; Game Theory; Risk Assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A novel theoretical perspective and an innovative approach are thus required forunderstanding security from decision-making and strategic viewpoint.

It can be utilized as a robust mathematicaltool for modelling and analyzing contemporary security issues. Game theory offers a natural frameworkfor capturing the defensive as well as adversarial interactions between the defenders and the attackers.Furthermore, defenders can attain a deep understanding of the potential attack threats and the strategiesof attackers by equilibrium evaluation of the security games.

Cyber Security Game is a method that has been implemented in software that quantitatively identifies cyber security risks and uses this metric to determine the optimal employment of security methods for any given investment level. Cyber Security Game maximizes a system’s ability to operate in today’s contested cyber environment by minimizing its mission risk. The risk score is calculated by using a mission impact model to compute the consequences of cyber incidents and combining that with the likelihood that attacks will succeed. The likelihood of attacks succeeding is computed by applying a threat model to a system topology model and defender model. Cyber Security Game takes into account the widespread interconnectedness of cyber systems, where defenders must defend all multi-step attack paths and an attacker only needs one to succeed. It employs a game theoretic solution using a game formulation that identifies defense strategies to minimize the maximum cyber risk (MiniMax).

A computable approach is proposed based on Bayesian updating to model awareness in a cybersecurity context. The process of gaining awareness considers the manager’s perception of the properties of the hacker’s actions, game history, and common knowledge. The role of awareness in strategy choices and outcomes is analyzed and simulated, providing insights into decision-making processes for managers and highlighting the need to consider probabilistic assessments of threats and the effectiveness of countermeasures. The accuracy of the initial frequencies plays a significant role in the manager’s success, with aligned frequencies leading to optimal results. Inaccurate information on prior frequencies still outperforms complete uncertainty, emphasizing the value of any available intelligence. However, the results suggest that other awareness modeling approaches are necessary to enhance the manager’s agility and adaptiveness when the prior frequencies do not reflect the immediate attacker’s type, indicating the need for improved intelligence about cyber-attacks and examinations of different awareness modeling approaches.","2024-04","2025-07-17 11:48:09","2025-07-17 11:48:09","2025-07-17 11:48:09","13","","2","15","","","Dynamic Awareness and Strategic Adaptation in Cybersecurity","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 2 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\53HGPEVL\Kostelić - 2024 - Dynamic Awareness and Strategic Adaptation in Cybersecurity A Game-Theory Approach.pdf","","","attacks; awareness; cybersecurity; game theory; strategies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although such cybersecurity research is important, few have paid attention to the dynamic interactions between attackers and defenders, where both sides are intelligent and will dynamically change their attack or defense strategies in order to gain the upper hand over their opponents. This 'cyberwar' phenomenon exists among most cybersecurity incidents in the real world, which warrants special research and analysis. In this paper, we propose a dynamic game theoretic framework (i.e., hyper defense) to analyze the interactions between the attacker and the defender as a non-cooperative security game. The key idea is to model attackers/defenders to have multiple levels of attack/defense strategies that are different in terms of effectiveness, strategy costs, and attack gains/damages. Each player adjusts his strategy based on the strategy's cost, potential attack gain/damage, and effectiveness in anticipating of the opponent's strategy. We study the achievable Nash equilibrium for the attacker-defender security game where the players employ an efficient strategy according to the obtained equilibrium. Furthermore, we present case studies of three different types of network attacks and put forth how our hyper defense system can successfully model them. Simulation results show that the proposed game theoretical system achieves a better performance compared to two other fixed-strategy defense systems.","2018-05","2025-07-17 11:48:20","2025-07-17 11:48:20","2025-07-17 11:48:20","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 1938-1883","","","","","Computational modeling; Computer security; Games; Heuristic algorithms; Nash equilibrium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here the authors studied a networked MG architecture, in which the control centre of microgrids communicates with a distribution network operator (DNO) to fulfil their local requirements. However, communication signals are always vulnerable to cyberattacks. While the surplus/deficit powers are reported by one MG to DNO, other MGs can act as potential cyber attackers aimed at decreasing their own costs. This action may also lead to threat the global optimisation of networked MGs. When an attacker manipulates the signal sent from the attacked MG to DNO, it will result in a false power interchange schedule produced by DNO. The attacker MG in the next step, maliciously accesses and changes the signal sent from the DNO to the attacked MG. In case a successful attack executed, the operation cost of the attacker MG will be decreased. Furthermore, a game-theoretic model of attacker–defender interaction is proposed, while different behaviours of players are addressed. The optimal scheduling scheme of MGs is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and solved by CPLEX.

Cybersecurity is a critical concern for many industries, such as railway, aviation, mining, construction, healthcare, and finance, where vital information and operational security are at risk of being compromised. Today, researchers are looking into various solutions to tackle cybersecurity risks while still retaining the desired functionality of the system. However, it is believed that these challenges can be approached by integrating game theory and the cyber kill chain (CKC), which describes the different stages of a cyberattack, to understand the complexities of cybersecurity. Thus, the primary objective of this paper is to demonstrate the application of a strategic game model within the context of cybersecurity, specifically using the cyber kill chain (CKC) model. The focus is on validating the proposed strategic game model through a case study. The case study involves a scenario where defenders select strategies such as “monitor system,” “detecting system,” and “respond to attack,” while attackers choose various attack strategies like “monitoring attack,” “scan the organization's website,” and “develop malicious payloads” within the stages of the CKC. This approach aims to enhance understanding of the complex challenges and facilitate the development of effective cybersecurity solutions. This approach will help in evaluating the effectiveness of different security strategies. The proposed strategic approach uses a non-cooperative game based on mixed strategies. The authors have defined a scenario for simultaneous-move games by estimating values for various elements of the game. By analysing the behaviour of both attacker and defender, the proposed game-based model can help industries develop more effective and efficient security strategies. Further, the proposed model will provide a better understanding of the complex challenges of cybersecurity in industrial contexts. It can also be used to develop appropriate strategies to mitigate cybersecurity risks.","2025-02-21","2025-07-17 11:48:30","2025-07-17 11:48:30","2025-07-17 11:48:30","","","","","","Int J  Syst  Assur  Eng  Manag","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\6A3TZTDS\Kour et al. - 2025 - Modelling cybersecurity strategies with game theory and cyber kill chain.pdf","","","Case study; Computer Crime; Cyber kill chain; Cybercrime; Cybersecurity; Game theory; Game Theory; Games Studies; Principles and Models of Security; Probabilities; Security Science and Technology; Strategic approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we propose a game theoretic model which optimally allocates cyber security resources such as administrators’ time across different tasks. We first model the interactions between an omnipresent attacker and a team of system administrators seen as the defender, and we have derived the mixed Nash Equilibria (NE) in such games. We have formulated general-sum games that represent our cyber security environment, and we have proven that the defender’s Nash strategy is also minimax. This result guarantees that independently from the attacker’s strategy the defender’s solution is optimal. We also propose Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as an efficient technique to compute approximate equilibria in our games. By implementing and evaluating a minimax solver with SVD, we have thoroughly investigated the improvement that Nash defense introduces compared to other strategies chosen by common sense decision algorithms. Our key finding is that a particular NE, which we call weighted NE, provides the most effective defense strategy. In order to validate this model we have used real-life statistics from Hackmageddon, the Verizon 2013 Data Breach Investigation report, and the Ponemon report of 2011. We finally compare the game theoretic defense method with a method which implements a stochastic optimization algorithm.","2014","2025-07-17 11:48:34","2025-07-17 11:48:34","","15-29","","","","","","","","","","","Springer","Berlin, Heidelberg","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\GSFSCN7B\Fielder et al. - 2014 - Game Theory Meets Information Security Management.pdf","","","cyber security; game theory; Information security management","Cuppens-Boulahia, Nora; Cuppens, Frédéric; Jajodia, Sushil; Abou El Kalam, Anas; Sans, Thierry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed additions and the development of game models of the interaction of the protection and attacking parties made it possible to develop a decision making algorithm based on a combination of several methods, in particular, expertise, game theory, etc. The practical value of the developed approach is confirmed by its implementation into the computing core of the decision support system for the selection of rational options of information security means (ISM) for ICS. The use of a decision making support system makes it possible to minimize the time spent on choosing rational sets of ISM according to ICS nodes under the conditions of implementation of complex attack scenarios by intruders.

As a result, training providers are seeking innovative ways to tackle current security challenges. Businesses in public and private sectors recognize the importance of implementing effective cyber security measures, one of which is training their employees. Many are taking active steps to ensure that employees and cyber security incident response teams (CSIRTs) can identify and respond to breaches through state-of-the-art training. There are indications that pioneering training programs like serious games (SGs), including tabletop exercises (TTXs), can play a role in CSIR training. This paper reviewed TTX related SGs literature, analyzed existing CSIR training exercises and reported how TTXs are currently being used in CSIR training. It also discussed why TTXs are increasingly becoming a popular tool for CSIR and emergency response (ER) training, analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of the current research and identified areas for future research. The findings suggest that TTX training improves the awareness, understanding, and preparation levels of CSIRTs. That TTXs enhance their strategic decision-making, enabling CSIRTs to be better prepared when dealing with security incidents. It observed that TTX related training improved the skills and aptitudes of CSIRTs and security operative center personnel. TTXs assist trainees to acquire and demonstrate both technical and nontechnical skills, including soft skills which are essential but often observed to be lacking in new graduates and some experienced technically minded personnel. TTX training augments traditional methods like classroom lectures by providing opportunities for experiential learning and practice-based approaches in dealing with real-life problems.","2020","2025-07-17 11:50:54","2025-07-17 11:50:54","2025-07-17 11:50:54","e126","","6","3","","","Game-based learning","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/spy2.126","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\Y9UCES4V\Angafor et al. - 2020 - Game-based learning A review of tabletop exercises for cybersecurity incident response training.pdf","","","cybersecurity; cybersecurity training; incident response; serious games; tabletop exercises","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within this open environment, the existence of an adversary introduces security risks. These can be related, for instance, to the theft of user data, and they vary depending on the security controls that each IoT prosumer has put in place. To minimize such risks, users might seek an “optimal” set of prosumers. However, assuming the adversary has the same information as the users about the existing security measures, he can then devise which prosumers will be preferable (e.g., with the highest security levels) and attack them more intensively. This paper proposes a decision-support approach that minimizes security risks in the above scenario. We propose a non-cooperative, two-player game entitled Prosumers Selection Game (PSG). The Nash Equilibria of PSG determine subsets of prosumers that optimize users' payoffs. We refer to any game solution as the Nash Prosumers Selection (NPS), which is a vector of probabilities over subsets of prosumers. We show that when using NPS, a user faces the least expected damages. Additionally, we show that according to NPS every prosumer, even the least secure one, is selected with some non-zero probability. We have also performed simulations to compare NPS against two different heuristic selection algorithms. The former is proven to be approximately 38% more effective in terms of security-risk mitigation.","2015-06","2025-07-17 11:52:38","2025-07-17 11:52:38","2025-07-17 11:52:38","2639-2644","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2164-7038","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\EVMU9HZX\Rontidis et al. - 2015 - A game-theoretic approach for minimizing security risks in the Internet-of-Things.pdf","","","Cascading style sheets; Conferences; Game theory; Games; Internet of things; Security; Silicon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most game-theoretic defensive deception approaches have assumed that players maintain consistent views under uncertainty. They do not consider players’ possible, subjective beliefs formed due to asymmetric information given to them. In this work, we formulate a hypergame between an attacker and a defender where they can interpret the same game differently and accordingly choose their best strategy based on their respective beliefs. This gives a chance for defensive deception strategies to manipulate an attacker’s belief, which is the key to the attacker’s decision-making. We consider advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks, which perform multiple attacks in the stages of the cyber kill chain (CKC) where both the attacker and the defender aim to select optimal strategies based on their beliefs. Through extensive simulation experiments, we demonstrated how effectively the defender can leverage defensive deception techniques while dealing with multi-staged APT attacks in a hypergame in which the imperfect information is reflected based on perceived uncertainty, cost, and expected utilities of both the attacker and defender, the system lifetime (i.e., mean time to security failure), and improved false-positive rates of intrusion detection.","2022-03","2025-07-17 11:53:12","2025-07-17 11:53:12","2025-07-17 11:53:12","112-129","","1","19","","","Foureye","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","","","","advanced persistent threat; Analytical models; attacker; defender; Defensive deception; Games; hypergame theory; Nash equilibrium; Predictive models; Reconnaissance; Stochastic processes; uncertainty; Uncertainty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These integrations make smart manufacturing systems more vulnerable to cyber threats. It is widely accepted that risk analysis is a function of (1) likelihood of attacks against an asset and (2) the consequences of such attacks. From a manufacturer’s viewpoint, forecasting behavior of attackers to estimate likelihood of attack is far more difficult, while the second variable is easier to determine based on the system’s configuration. In this paper, cost functions are considered as financial loss to address the consequences of attacks. The game theory approach is utilized to model the rivalry of cyber attackers and the manufacturing systems as the defender. Then, to solve the game, a statistical approach, the quantal response equilibrium (QRE), is applied to find the likelihood of attack and predict the behavior of attackers. The attackers’ behavior is investigated under different circumstances to find the best defensive strategy against expected attacks and analyze the cybersecurity risks in manufacturing systems.","2018-01-01","2025-07-17 11:53:24","2025-07-17 11:53:24","2025-07-17 11:53:24","1001-1008","","","17","","Procedia Manufacturing","","28th International Conference on Flexible Automation and Intelligent Manufacturing (FAIM2018), June 11-14, 2018, Columbus, OH, USAGlobal Integration of Intelligent Manufacturing and Smart Industry for Good of Humanity","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Cybersecurity in Manufacturing; Game Theory; Quantal Response Equilibrium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is commonly interpreted to mean preventing online sabotage against utilities such as electricity,oil and gas, water, and sewage - including pipelines, refineries, generators, storage depots and transport facilities such as tankers and terminals. A consensus is emerging that the protection of such assets is more a matter of business models and regulation - in short, of security economics - than of technology. We describe the problems, and the state of play, in this paper. Industrial control systems operate in a different world from systems previously studied by security economists; we find the same issues (lock-in, externalities, asymmetric information and so on) but in different forms. Lock-in is physical, rather than based on network effects, while the most serious externalities result from correlated failure, whether from cascade failures, common-mode failures or simultaneous attacks. There is also an interesting natural experiment happening, in that the USA is regulating cyber security in the electric power industry, but not in oil and gas, while the UK is not regulating at all but rather encouraging industry’s own efforts. Some European governments are intervening, while others are leaving cybersecurity entirely to plant owners to worry about. We already note some perverse effects of the U.S. regulation regime as companies game the system, to the detriment of overall dependability.","2010","2025-07-17 11:58:18","2025-07-17 11:58:18","","55-66","","","","","","","","","","","Springer US","Boston, MA","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Moore, Tyler; Pym, David; Ioannidis, Christos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"VA8PY2DV","journalArticle","","Anderson, Ross; Fuloria, Shailendra","On the security economics of electricity metering","","","","","","Smart grids are a hot topic, with the US administration devoting billions of dollars to modernising the electricity infrastructure. Signiﬁcant action is likely in metering, where the largest and most radical change may come in the European Union. The EU is strongly encouraging its 27 Member States to replace utility meters with ‘smart meters’ by 2022. This will be a massive project: the UK, for example, looks set to replace 47m meters at a cost of perhaps £350 each. Yet it is not at all clear what it means for a meter to be secure. The utility wants to cut energy theft, so it wants the ability to disable any meter remotely; but a prudent nation state might be wary of a facility that could let an attacker turn oﬀ the lights. Again, the utility may want to monitor its customers’ consumption by the half hour, so it can price discriminate more eﬀectively; the competition authorities may ﬁnd this abhorrent. Other parts of government might ﬁnd it convenient to have access to ﬁne-grained consumption data, but might ﬁnd themselves up against privacy law. There are at least half-a-dozen diﬀerent stakeholders with diﬀerent views on security – which can refer to information, to money, or to the supply of electricity. And it’s not even true that more security is always better: some customers may opt for an interruptible supply to save money. In short, energy metering is ripe for a security-economics analysis, and in this paper we attempt a ﬁrst cut. We end up with ﬁve recommendations for the regulation of a future smart meter infrastructure.","","2025-07-17 11:58:41","2025-07-17 11:58:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\Q5JZZ9S4\Anderson and Fuloria - On the security economics of electricity metering.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conceptualize the security issues from the perspective of the HTTPS value chain. We then discuss the breaches at several Certificate Authorities (CAs). Next, we explore the security incentives of CAs via the empirical analysis of the market for SSL certificates, based on the SSL Observatory dataset. This uncovers a surprising pattern: there is no race to the bottom. Rather, we find a highly concentrated market with very large price differences among suppliers and limited price competition. We explain this pattern and explore what it tells us about the security incentives of CAs, including how market leaders seem to benefit from the status quo. In light of these findings, we look at regulatory and technical proposals to address the systemic vulnerabilities in the HTTPS value chain, in particular the EU eSignatures proposal that seeks to strictly regulate HTTPS communications.","2013-03-01","2025-07-17 11:58:43","2025-07-17 11:58:43","2025-07-17 11:58:43","","","","","","","","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","","","","","","Certificate Authorities; Constitutional Values; Cybersecurity; Digital Certificates; E-Commerce; eSignatures Regulation; GigaNet; HTTPS; Internet Governance; Security Economics; SSL; TLS; Value Chain Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2277806","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large organizations such as Sony or Lockheed Martin were recently attacked and lost confidential customer information. Besides targeted attacks, virus and malware infections, lost or stolen laptops and mobile devices, or the abuse of the organizational IT through employees, to name but a few, also put the security of assets in jeopardy. To defend against IS threats, organizations invest in IS countermeasures preventing, or, at least, reducing the probability and the impact of IS breaches. As IS budgets are constrained and the number of assets to be protected is large, IS investments need to be deliberately evaluated. Several approaches for the evaluation of IS investments are presented in the literature. In this chapter, we identify, compare, and evaluate such approaches using the example of a policy and security configuration management tool. Such a tool is expected to reduce the costs of organizational policy and security configuration management and to increase the trustworthiness of organizations. It was found that none of the analyzed approaches can be used without reservation for the assessment of the economic viability of the policy and security configuration management tool used as an example.

However, online advertisements have become a serious problem for many Internet users: while some are merely annoyed by the incessant display of distracting ads cluttering Web pages, others are highly concerned about the privacy implications – as ad providers typically track users’ behavior for ad targeting purposes. Similarly, security problems related to technologies and practices employed for online advertisement have frustrated many users. Consequently, a number of software solutions have emerged that block online ads from being downloaded and displayed on users’ screens as they browse the Web. We focus on these advertisement avoidance technologies for online content and their economic ramifications for the monetization of websites. More specifically, our work addresses the interplay between users’ attempts to avoid commercial messages and content providers’ design of countermeasures. Our investigation is substantiated by the development of a game-theoretic model that serves as a framework usable by content providers to ponder their options to mitigate the consequences of ad avoidance techniques. We complement our analytical approach with simulation results, addressing different assumptions about user heterogeneity. Our findings show that publishers who treat each user individually, and strategically deploy fee-financed or ad-financed monetization strategy, obtain higher revenues, compared to deploying one monetization strategy across all users. In addition, our analysis shows that understanding the distribution of users’ aversion to ads and valuation of the content is essential for publishers to make a well-informed decision.","2013","2025-07-17 11:59:04","2025-07-17 11:59:04","2025-07-17 11:58:59","49-73","","","","","","Ad-Blocking Games","","","","","Springer","Berlin, Heidelberg","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-39498-0_3","","","","","","Böhme, Rainer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The initial workshop paper was prepared in response to a request from the UK Ministry of Defence following scepticism that previous studies had hyped the problem. For each of the main categories of cybercrime we set out what is and is not known of the direct costs, indirect costs and defence costs – both to the UK and to the world as a whole. We distinguish carefully between traditional crimes that are now “cyber” because they are conducted online (such as tax and welfare fraud); transitional crimes whose modus operandi has changed substantially as a result of the move online (such as credit card fraud); new crimes that owe their existence to the Internet; and what we might call platform crimes such as the provision of botnets which facilitate other crimes rather than being used to extract money from victims directly. As far as direct costs are concerned, we find that traditional offences such as tax and welfare fraud cost the typical citizen in the low hundreds of pounds/euros/dollars a year; transitional frauds cost a few pounds/euros/dollars; while the new computer crimes cost in the tens of pence/cents. However, the indirect costs and defence costs are much higher for transitional and new crimes. For the former they may be roughly comparable to what the criminals earn, while for the latter they may be an order of magnitude more. As a striking example, the botnet behind a third of the spam sent in 2010 earned its owners around $2.7 million, while worldwide expenditures on spam prevention probably exceeded a billion dollars. We are extremely inefficient at fighting cybercrime; or to put it another way, cyber-crooks are like terrorists or metal thieves in that their activities impose disproportionate costs on society. Some of the reasons for this are well-known: cybercrimes are global and have strong externalities, while traditional crimes such as burglary and car theft are local, and the associated equilibria have emerged after many years of optimisation. As for the more direct question of what should be done, our figures suggest that we should spend less in anticipation of cybercrime (on antivirus, firewalls, etc.) and more in response – that is, on the prosaic business of hunting down cyber-criminals and throwing them in jail.","2013","2025-07-17 11:59:04","2025-07-17 11:59:04","2025-07-17 11:58:59","265-300","","","","","","","","","","","Springer","Berlin, Heidelberg","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-39498-0_12","","","","","","Böhme, Rainer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this empirical study, we used an inter-regional input–output table in order to analyze both sectoral and regional interdependencies under the influence of information technology and the information security of Japanese firms. Our analysis showed that the economic scale of a region has a great influence on the characteristics of the interdependency. Furthermore, we found that the demand-side sectors can be classified into five classes based on the characteristics. Among them, the groups with high self-dependency get more benefits from simultaneous understanding of regional characteristics; for the sectors in these classes, investment advice obtained from sectoral characteristics only is very limited, whereas they can obtain much more from regional characteristics. Since these classes include a majority of the sectors, we can recognize the importance of regional interdependency analysis. In the above basic study, what we see is the situation before the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011.As an extended study, we estimated the impact of the earthquake on the interdependency. Our main finding from the regional perspective is that the interdependency characteristics of the most damaged region (Tohoku) and of the economically largest region (Kanto) are impacted most significantly. This feature is not changed by the limitation of damage through prior security investment.Both in the basic study and in the extended study, we can see that considering not only sectoral but also regional characteristics is an effective approach to the task of empirically deriving implications related to the interdependency.

Some hypotheses appear to hold, e.g. Internet penetration, English literacy, size of the labor market, and government policy all are significant indicators of crowd-sourced ecrime market participation. Greater governmental transparency, less corruption, and more consistent rule of law lower the participation rate in ecrime. Other results are counter-intuitive.

Most prominently, the Bitcoin cryptographic currency protocol leverages PoW to (1) prevent double spending and (2) establish scarcity, two essential properties of any electronic currency. This chapter asks the important question whether this approach is generally viable. Citing actual data, it provides a first cut of an answer by estimating the resource requirements, in terms of operating cost and ecological footprint, of a suitably dimensioned PoW infrastructure and comparing them to three attack scenarios. The analysis is inspired by Bitcoin, but generalizes to potential successors, which fix Bitcoin’s technical and economic teething troubles discussed in the literature.","2013","2025-07-17 11:59:04","2025-07-17 11:59:04","2025-07-17 11:58:59","135-156","","","","","","Can We Afford Integrity by Proof-of-Work?","","","","","Springer","Berlin, Heidelberg","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-39498-0_7","","","","","","Böhme, Rainer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Privacy concerns, time spent, and typing effort act as a major deterrent to completing Web forms. Yet consumers regularly provide more data than required. In a field experiment, we recruited 1,500 Web users to complete a form asking for ten items of identity and profile information of varying levels of sensitivity. We manipulated the number of mandatory fields (none vs. two) and the compensation for participation ($0.25 vs. $0.50) to quantify the extent of over-disclosure, the motives behind it, and the resulting costs and privacy invasion. We benchmarked the efficiency of compulsion and incentives in soliciting data against voluntary disclosure alone.We observed a high prevalence of deliberate and unpaid over-disclosure of data. Participants regularly completed more form fields than required, or provided more details than requested. Through careful experimental design, we verified that participants understood that additional data disclosure was voluntary, and the information provided was considered sensitive. In our experiment, we found that making some fields mandatory jeopardised voluntary disclosure for the remaining optional fields. Conversely, monetary incentives for disclosing those same fields yielded positive spillover by increasing revelation ratios for other optional fields. We discuss the implications for commercial website operators, regulators, privacy-enhancing browser standards, and further experimental research in privacy economics.","2013","2025-07-17 11:59:04","2025-07-17 11:59:04","2025-07-17 11:58:59","183-209","","","","","","","","","","","Springer","Berlin, Heidelberg","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-39498-0_9","","","","","","Böhme, Rainer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From a business-perspective, cost-benefit justifications for information security investments are in focus. While previous research has mostly focused on economic models for security investments, or on how to quantify the benefits of information security, this chapter aims to take a closer look at the costs of information security. After providing the reader with basic knowledge and motivation for the topic, we identify and describe the problems and difficulties in quantifying an enterprise’s cost for information security in a comprehensive and comparable way. Of these issues, the lack of a common model of costs of information security is the most prominent one. This chapter also discusses four approaches to categorize and determine the costs of information security in an enterprise. Starting with the classic approach frequently used in surveys, we continue by describing three alternative approaches. To support research on the costs of information security we propose two metrics. We conclude with input for future research, especially for an empirical analysis of the topic.","2013","2025-07-17 11:59:04","2025-07-17 11:59:04","2025-07-17 11:58:59","3-24","","","","","","","","","","","Springer","Berlin, Heidelberg","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-39498-0_1","","","","","","Böhme, Rainer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We explore how choice architecture affects smartphone users’ stated willingness to install applications that request varying permissions. We performed two experiments to gauge smartphone users’ stated willingness to pay premiums to limit their personal information exposure when installing applications. When participants were comparison shopping between multiple applications that performed similar functionality, a quarter of our sample indicated a willingness to pay a $1.50 premium for the application that requested the fewest permissions—though only when viewing the requested permissions of each application side-by-side. In a second experiment, we more closely simulated the user experience by asking them to valuate a single application that featured multiple sets of permissions based on five between-subjects conditions. In this scenario, the requested permissions had a much smaller impact. Our results suggest that many smartphone users are concerned with their privacy and are willing to pay premiums for applications that are less likely to request access to personal information, but that the current choice architectures do not support this. We propose improvements for smartphone application markets that could result in decreased satisficing and increased rational behavior.","2013","2025-07-17 11:59:04","2025-07-17 11:59:04","2025-07-17 11:58:59","211-236","","","","","","Choice Architecture and Smartphone Privacy","","","","","Springer","Berlin, Heidelberg","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-39498-0_10","","","","","","Böhme, Rainer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are always looking to improve the effectiveness of their predictions, which means improving the algorithms and/or collecting different data. Research on financial behavior found that elements of a person’s family history and social ties can be good predictors of financial responsibility and control. Our study investigated how loan applicants applying for a credit card would respond to questions such as “Did any of your loved ones die while you were growing up?” 48 participants were asked to complete a new type of credit card application form containing such requests as part of a “Consumer Acceptance Test” of a credit card with lower interest rates, but only available to “financially responsible customers.” This was a double-blind study—the experimenters processing participants were told exactly the same. We found that: (1) more sensitive items are disclosed less often—e.g., friends’ names and contact had only a 69 % answer rate; (2) privacy fundamentalists are 5.6 times less likely to disclose data; and (3) providing a justification for a question has no effect on its answer rate. Discrepancies between acceptability and disclosure were observed—e.g., 43 % provided names and contact of friends, having said they found the question unacceptable. We conclude that collecting data items not traditionally seen as relevant could be made acceptable if lenders can credibly establish relevance, and assure applicants they will be assessed fairly. More research needs to be done on how to best communicate these qualities.","2013","2025-07-17 11:59:04","2025-07-17 11:59:04","2025-07-17 11:59:00","237-261","","","","","","Would You Sell Your Mother’s Data?","","","","","Springer","Berlin, Heidelberg","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-39498-0_11","","","","","","Böhme, Rainer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By using collected data from a survey that we conducted, and employing a stepwise logit model, we analyze the relationships above. The primary results are as follows: First of all, myopic cognition and hyperopic cognition measured by the CFC scale have effects on the behaviors of violating organizational rules in almost all cases. Next, in many cases, individuals whose information security awareness is higher tend not to violate the rules. Third, the behavior of violating the rules is independent of the size of the organization, and is not related to the degree of workplace satisfaction and the evaluation toward the managers in some cases. Fourth, in an organization in which permanent employment is implemented, individuals tend to violate the rules. It is not easy to control psychological factors such as an individual’s attitude toward risk. Conversely, the factors regarded as organizational attributes, such as the degree of workplace satisfaction or the employment system utilized, may be controlled by designing the appropriate organizational environment. Consequently, we consider that it may be effective to improve information security awareness by information security education and training.","2013","2025-07-17 11:59:04","2025-07-17 11:59:04","2025-07-17 11:59:00","95-114","","","","","","","","","","","Springer","Berlin, Heidelberg","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-39498-0_5","","","","","","Böhme, Rainer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, recent research shows that most Information Sharing and Analysis Centers do not perform optimally, even when properly regulated. Using a meso-level of analysis, we close an important research gap by presenting a theoretical framework that links institutional economics and security information sharing. We illustrate this framework with a dataset collected through an online questionnaire addressed to all critical infrastructures (N = 262) operating at the Swiss Reporting and Analysis Centre for Information Security (MELANI). Using descriptive statistics, we investigate how institutional rules offer human agents an institutional freedom to self-design an efficient security information sharing artifact. Our results show that a properly designed artifact can positively reinforces human agents to share security information and find the right balance between three governance models: (A) public-private partnership, (B) private, and (C) government-based. Overall, our work lends support to a better institutional design of security information sharing and the formulation of policies that can avoid non-cooperative and free-riding behaviors that plague cybersecurity.","2019","2025-07-17 11:59:38","2025-07-17 11:59:38","","179-190","","","","","","Governance Models Preferences for Security Information Sharing","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Luiijf, Eric; Žutautaitė, Inga; Hämmerli, Bernhard M.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the free rider problem remains a major pitfall, preventing the full potential benefits of SIS from being realised. This paper closes an important research gap by providing a theoretical framework linking incentives and voluntary SIS. This framework was applied to CIP through a case study of the Swiss Reporting and Analysis Centre for Information Security. The SIS model was used to analyse the incentive mechanisms that most effectively support SIS for CIP.

At the micro level of analysis, as an example, this paper highlights discussions on the economics of security in the cloud. Do we really understand the economics of security in the cloud? Are there economic models that capture operational security in the cloud? Early work at HP Labs on trust economics underpins a systematic approach to information security decision-making and risk management. The results on trust economics highlight how economics may drive operational security and the deployment of security technologies. At the macro level of analysis, drawn from ongoing work within the Security and Trust Coordination and Enhanced Collaboration, this paper links economics to innovation in cyber security and privacy. Despite the R&D investments in cyber security and privacy, the general perception is that security and privacy technologies are deployed ineffectively.

A challenge is that the choices are hard: money is tight, objectives are not clear, and there are many relevant experts and stakeholders. A significant proportion of the research in security economics is about helping people and organisations make better security investment and policy decisions.This paper looks at the impact of methods based on security economics on a set of decision makers. Importantly, the study focused upon experienced security professionals using a realistic security problem relating to client infrastructure. Results indicated that the methods changed the decision processes for these experienced security professionals. Specifically, a broader range of factors were accounted for and included as justifications for the decisions selected. The security professional is an (important and influential) stakeholder in the organization decision making process, and arguably a more complete understanding of the problem is more suitable for persuading a broader business audience.More generally the study complements all research in security economics that is aimed at improving decision making, and suggests ways to proceed and test for the impact of new methods on the actual decision makers.","2013","2025-07-17 12:00:34","2025-07-17 12:00:34","","213-238","","","","","","","","","","","Springer","New York, NY","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Schneier, Bruce","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our four stage plan to Capture, Adapt, Realign, and Enable behaviour choices provides guidance for security managers, focusing on a more effective response to the uncertainty associated with security behaviour in organizations.","2022-07-04","2025-07-17 12:00:38","2025-07-17 12:00:38","2025-07-17 12:00:38","435-464","","3","30","","","The boundedly rational employee","","","","","","","EN","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\ADGHMN9D\Demjaha et al. - 2022 - The boundedly rational employee Security economics for behaviour intervention support in organizati.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such failures to comply may simply be innocent mistakes. However, there is evidence that, in some circumstances, users choose not to comply because they perceive that the security benefit of compliance is outweighed by the cost that is the impact of compliance on their abilities to complete their operational tasks. That is, they perceive security compliance as hindering their work. The ‘compliance budget’ is a concept in information security that describes how the users of an organization’s systems determine the extent to which they comply with the specified security policy. The purpose of this paper is to initiate a qualitative logical analysis of, and so provide reasoning tools for, this important concept in security economics for which quantitative analysis is difficult to establish. We set up a simple temporal logic of preferences, with a semantics given in terms of histories and sets of preferences, and explain how to use it to model and reason about the compliance budget. The key ingredients are preference update, to account for behavioural change in response to policy change, and an ability to handle uncertainty, to account for the lack of quantitative measures.","2016","2025-07-17 12:05:03","2025-07-17 12:05:03","","370-381","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Zhu, Quanyan; Alpcan, Tansu; Panaousis, Emmanouil; Tambe, Milind; Casey, William","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"HKTHBHTE","journalArticle","","Baddeley, Michelle","Information Security: Lessons from Behavioural Economics","","","","","","Psychological and sociological factors constrain economic decision-making in many contexts including the online world. In particular, uncertainty limits the optimising behaviour which is often the focus of economic models and so people will be forced to rely on simpler decision-making rules when managing information online. Behavioural economics and economic psychology emphasise that people will make many mistakes in processing information and planning for the future and these mistakes will also distort learning processes. Emotions and visceral factors will play a key role - not only aﬀecting people’s actions and choices but also the connection between information, learning and choices. All these forces will have wide-ranging implications for information security management and this paper summarises some of the key insights and policy lessons for information security.","","2025-07-17 12:06:37","2025-07-17 12:06:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\WIS8JAGE\Baddeley - Information Security Lessons from Behavioural Economics.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some social influences are valuable – for example, replicating results is a valuable aspect of scientific research and if a hypothesis has genuinely been verified across a range of different studies, then that may be because it is more probable. In uncertain situations, however, people employ heuristics and rules of thumb to guide their interpretation of events, and this can create problems of cognitive bias, including group biases when beliefs tend to coincide with the prior opinions of others, thus creating herding and path dependency. This tendency to follow others may be magnified by other social influences including reputation-building and conformity preference. Insights about herding and social influence are used to build a model of relative rewards to consensus versus contrarianism.

"ZA2857D5","book","2017","Baddeley, Michelle","Behavioural Economics: A Very Short Introduction","","978-0-19-875499-2","","","","Traditionally, economists have based their economic predictions on the assumption that humans are super-rational creatures, using the information we are given efficiently and generally making selfish decisions. Economists also assume that we're doing the very best we can possibly do--not only for today, but over our whole lifetimes too.  The study of behavioral economics is revealing that our lives are not that simple. Instead, our decisions are complicated by our own psychology. Each of us makes mistakes every day. We don't always know what's best for us and, even if we do, we might not have the self-control to deliver on our best intentions. We struggle to stay on diets, to get enough exercise and to manage our money. We misjudge risky situations. We are prone to herding: sometimes peer pressure leads us blindly to copy others around us; other times copying others helps us to learn quickly about new, unfamiliar situations.  This Very Short Introduction explores the reasons why we make irrational decisions; how we decide quickly; why we make mistakes in risky situations; our tendency to procrastination; and how we are affected by social influences, personality, mood and emotions. The implications of understanding the rationale for our own financial behavior are huge. Behavioral economics could help policy-makers to understand the people behind their policies, enabling them to design more effective policies, while at the same time we could find ourselves assaulted by increasingly savvy marketing. Michelle Baddeley concludes by looking forward, to see what the future of behavioral economics holds for us.  ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly.

Convergence of viewpoints may reflect reasonable compromises, for example if jury deliberations reflect informational influences and social learning which allow individual jurors to correct biases, misunderstandings and/or imperfect recall of evidence. Conversely, some individuals may converge towards others’ viewpoints because of normative influences including peer pressure and preferences for conformity and these can generate biases in the final jury judgements. This paper presents experimental data showing that groups do have a significant tendency to compromise in jury-like settings. Econometric evidence shows that group characteristics, including the presence of acquaintances and strangers within the jury group, affect the extent of compromise. The implications are that jury deliberations may be biased by factors not relevant to a specific case, limiting the objectivity of jury decisions.","2012-10-01","2025-07-17 12:06:54","2025-07-17 12:06:54","2025-07-17 12:06:54","558-573","","5","41","","The Journal of Socio-Economics","Group decision-making","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Behavioural economics; Herding; Legal decision-making; Personality; Social influence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Upgrades bring costs, imposing a need to refamiliarize ourselves with a new version after mastering the old one. It is important to understand such costs as failure to upgrade can make users vulnerable to security risks. We first review multiple studies showing users’ dislike of upgrades resulting from changes introduced to the interface. Then we propose a framework to analyze the nature of upgrade costs, explaining their origins using well-validated cognitive psychology concepts including: cognitive automation, negative transfer, cognitive maps, procedural memory and locus of control. We use these concepts to explain the psychological costs of frequent interface changes while sketching some approaches to addressing them. Although new versions are necessary for progress, this paper provides software developers with a deeper understanding of the sometimes overlooked costs of frequent interface changes.","2018-01-01","2025-07-17 12:07:30","2025-07-17 12:07:30","2025-07-17 12:07:30","46-52","","1","30","","Interacting with Computers","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on previous research on usable security and economics of security, we propose a new approach to managing employee security behaviour. We conducted interviews with 17 employees from two major commercial organizations, asking why they do or don't comply with security policies. Our results show that key factors in the compliance decision are the actual and anticipated cost and benefits of compliance to the individual employee, and perceived cost and benefits to the organization. We present a new paradigm -- the Compliance Budget - as a means of understanding how individuals perceive the costs and benefits of compliance with organisational security goals, and identify a range of approaches that security managers can use to influence employee's perceptions (which, in turn, influence security behaviour). The Compliance Budget should be understood and managed in the same way as any financial budget, as compliance directly affects, and can place a cap on, effectiveness of organisational security measures.","2008-09-22","2025-07-17 12:07:47","2025-07-17 12:07:47","2025-07-17","47–58","","","","","","The compliance budget","NSPW '08","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since extremely vulnerable information sets may be inordinately expensive to protect, a firm may be better off concentrating its efforts on information sets with midrange vulnerabilities. The analysis further suggests that to maximize the expected benefit from investment to protect information, a firm should spend only a small fraction of the expected loss due to a security breach.","2002-11-01","2025-07-17 12:08:00","2025-07-17 12:08:00","2025-07-17 12:08:00","438–457","","4","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An analysis of 93 interviews with staff from 2 multinational organizations revealed that security behavior is driven by a combination of risk understanding and emotional stance towards security policy. Furthermore, we found that a quantitative analysis of these dimensions is capable of differentiating between the staff populations of the two organizations. Organization B showed a healthier set of security behaviors, as a result of its employees having better risk understanding and a more positive emotional stance. The framework distinguishes between 16 theoretical behavioral types, (3 of which are rule breakers, excuse makers and security champions). It can be used to identify groups of employees that potentially pose a risk to the organization, as well as those with beneficial skills and expertise. This allows highly specific messages to be targeted to change the risk perception and emotional stance of such groups. Assuming the organization has ensured security hygiene (i.e. its policies can be complied with in the context of productive activity), this can shift behavior towards compliance. Our framework thus offers diagnostic and intervention-shaping tools for the next step in improving security culture.","2015-09-08","2025-07-17 12:08:23","2025-07-17 12:08:23","2025-07-17","73–84","","","","","","Employee Rule Breakers, Excuse Makers and Security Champions","NSPW '15","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As senior management's uncertainty with respect to the information systems function increases, we argue they will delegate more decision rights to the information systems manager. As a result of increased agency costs, senior management will demand more information systems planning to provide the basis for monitoring and bonding of the manager. In addition, because information systems plans may be used to resolve the distribution of gains and losses between senior management and the information systems manager in the event of unforeseen circumstances, both senior management and the information systems manager will seek to exercise control over the planning process and the form of the final plan. We argue that the relative specialization of human capital of senior management versus the information systems manager will dictate whose views dominate in the preparation of and form of the information systems plan. Our empirical results show moderate support for our model.","1996-07","2025-07-17 12:09:39","2025-07-17 12:09:39","2025-07-17 12:09:39","1043-1064","","7","42","","","Information Systems Planning","","","","","","","","","","","","pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: INFORMS","","","","","agency theory; contingency models of planning; information systems planning; transaction-costs economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More recently, researchers have developed far more decentralized intrusion detection systems using a variety of techniques. Such systems often rely upon data sharing between sites which do not have a common administrator and therefore cooperation will be required in order to detect and respond to security incidents. It has therefore become important to address cooperation and data sharing in a formal manner.In this paper, we discuss the detection of distributed attacks across cooperating enterprises. We begin by defining relationships between cooperative hosts, then use the take-grant model to identify both when a host could identify a widespread attack and when that host is at increased risk due to data sharing. We further refine our definition of potential identification using access, integrity, and cooperation policies which limit sharing. Finally, we include a brief description of both a simple Prolog model encorporating data sharing policies and a prototype cooperative intrusion detection system.","2000-02-01","2025-07-17 12:09:50","2025-07-17 12:09:50","2025-07-17 12:09:50","1–29","","1","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\45RPAT5R\Frincke - 2000 - Balancing cooperation and risk in intrusion detection.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We derive the system’s stability conditions and find that they admit a wide choice of parameters.

In addition, the report surveys the European research capacity in the field of security economics. The study is based on a thorough literature survey of the newly emerging field of security economics, using a variety of electronic catalogues and search engines as sources. The study reveals that it is not just terror attacks but also security measures of private and public agents responding to the threat of terrorism that incur significant repercussions for the economy, often with trans-national consequences. Impacts vary with the maturity of an economy; appropriate ex ante and ex post policies are critical to contain the damage of terrorism. Given the dynamic nature of human-induced insecurity, policies should place emphasis on ""systemic resilience"". Gaps in the economic security literature include insufficient knowledge of the behaviour of terrorists and their targets. Furthermore, the global impacts of terror attacks and especially of security measures require more analysis. Future research requires a more rigorous conceptual framework, methodological improvements and, above all, better data. In comparison to the United States, the current research capacity in security economics in Europe is weak. On the one hand, there is significant research potential in the field of security economics within the European Union in the shape of several high quality researchers. On the other hand, the existing research infrastructure and institutional barriers both inhibit this potential from being developed academically and for policy advice. Establishing a European network of security economists and funding a European centre for security economics could contribute to remedy this situation.","2008","2025-07-17 22:25:11","2025-07-17 22:25:11","2025-07-17 22:25:11","","","","","","","A Survey on the Economics of Security","","","","","DIW Berlin: Politikberatung kompakt","","eng","http://www.econstor.eu/dspace/Nutzungsbedingungen","Research Report","","","www.econstor.eu","","ISBN: 9783938762325","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\CITN9DC7\Brück et al. - 2008 - A Survey on the Economics of Security Final Report for the European Commission, Directorate-General.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

US policymakers today increasingly view China as the main challenge to the latter. Accordingly, this article’s driving hypothesis is that the more significance the USA assigns to its European allies in the context of its China agenda, the more it will, for better or worse, seek to maintain (some degree of) European security dependence on the USA.

A three-phase–based model of vulnerability rate evolution over time is proposed and used to estimate the different planned security expenditures throughout the investment horizon. At the starting time of investment, a decision maker invests to cover the existing risk of breach and periodically spends to cover the additional risk observed due to the release of new vulnerabilities.

Decision-makers then face choices, where this is not simply a binary decision of whether to comply or not, but also how to approach compliance and secure working alongside other workplace pressures, and limited resources for identifying optimal security-related choices. Conflict arises due to information asymmetries present in the relationship, where influencers and decision-makers both consider costs, gains, and losses in ways which are not necessarily aligned. With the need to promote ‘good enough’ decisions about security-related behaviours under such constraints, we hypothesize that actions to resolve this misalignment can benefit from constructs from both traditional economics and behavioural economics. Here we demonstrate how current approaches to security behaviour provisioning in organizations mirror rational-agent economics, even where behavioural economics is embodied in the promotion of individual security behaviours. We develop and present a framework to accommodate bounded security decision-making, within an ongoing programme of behaviours which must be provisioned for and supported. We also point to applications of the framework in negotiating sustainable security behaviours, such as policy concordance and just security cultures.","2021","2025-07-17 22:25:46","2025-07-17 22:25:46","","66-86","","","","","","You’ve Left Me No Choices","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Groß, Thomas; Tryfonas, Theo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This field provides valuable insights not only for security experts, but also for policy makers, business managers, economists and psychologists. In this paper, we are going to discuss the emergence and evolution of economics of information security; where it came from, where it is today and its future directions. Research conducted for this survey explores the literature on economic issues in information security and review the advantages, drawbacks, and future research directions to set the scene that the assessment and analysis of the economics of information security publications followed it. Furthermore, we provide a structured discussion and overview of selected sets of works and highlight the models and theories in this field by organizing the presented works into six main categories namely information security investment, trust and privacy, network security, malicious program and malware economics, penetration testing and digital forensics and software security. Additionally, this survey aims to familiarize readers with major areas of this field already in hand to indicate the gaps and overlooked issues in the economics of security.","","2025-07-17 22:25:59","2025-07-17 22:25:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\7L8PQJBL\Aminnezhad et al. - Survey on Economics of Information Security.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It comprises the identification, assessment, and prioritization of potential security risks to an organization's information assets as well as the implementation of protective measures or risk management plans. For this method to work, a detailed understanding of an organization's assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts of security incidents is required. Effective information security risk management ensures business continuity, safeguards critical information assets, and prevents data breaches. In this study, the key concepts, practices, and tools of information security risk management are discussed.

Studied methods allow the user to receive a quantitative risk assessment of the system. This makes it possible to eliminate the need to use expensive resources to identify risks. Research was conducted on building an Information Security Risk Management System, measures and procedures for identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling and minimizing information security risks. The purpose of the Information Security Risk Management System is to prevent and reduce the threat of negative consequences associated with the operation of information systems, as well as external factors affecting information systems.

This is commonly interpreted to mean preventing online sabotage against utilities such as electricity,oil and gas, water, and sewage - including pipelines, refineries, generators, storage depots and transport facilities such as tankers and terminals. A consensus is emerging that the protection of such assets is more a matter of business models and regulation - in short, of security economics - than of technology. We describe the problems, and the state of play, in this paper. Industrial control systems operate in a different world from systems previously studied by security economists; we find the same issues (lock-in, externalities, asymmetric information and so on) but in different forms. Lock-in is physical, rather than based on network effects, while the most serious externalities result from correlated failure, whether from cascade failures, common-mode failures or simultaneous attacks. There is also an interesting natural experiment happening, in that the USA is regulating cyber security in the electric power industry, but not in oil and gas, while the UK is not regulating at all but rather encouraging industry’s own efforts. Some European governments are intervening, while others are leaving cybersecurity entirely to plant owners to worry about. We already note some perverse effects of the U.S. regulation regime as companies game the system, to the detriment of overall dependability.","2010","2025-07-17 22:27:17","2025-07-17 22:27:17","","55-66","","","","","","","","","","","Springer US","Boston, MA","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Moore, Tyler; Pym, David; Ioannidis, Christos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We suggest that an understanding of the true cost of additional policies to control insider threats, and the dynamic nature of potential insider threats together help explain why this observed behavior is economically rational. This conclusion also suggests that further work needs to be done to understand how better to change underlying motivations of insiders, rather than simply focus on controlling and monitoring their behavior.","2010","2025-07-17 22:27:17","2025-07-17 22:27:17","","279-299","","","","","","","","","","","Springer US","Boston, MA","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Moore, Tyler; Pym, David; Ioannidis, Christos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Appropriate regulation of identity in a ubiquitous information environment is seen as one of the major drivers of the future Internet economy. Regulation of personal identity data has come to the fore including mapping conducted on digital personhood by the OECD; work on human rights and profiling by the Council of Europe andmajor studies by the European Commission with regard to self-regulation in the privacy market, electronic identity technical interoperability and enhanced safety for young people. These domains overlap onto an increasingly complex model of regulation of individuals' identity management, online and offline. This chapter argues that policy makers struggle to deal with issues concerning electronic identity, due to the apparently irrational and unpredictable behavior of users when engaging in online interactions involving identity management. Building on empirical survey evidence from four EU countries, we examine the first aspect in detail – citizens' management of identity in a digital environment. We build on data from a large scale (n = 5,265) online survey of attitudes to electronic identity among young Europeans (France, Germany, Spain, UK) conducted in August 2008. The survey asked questions about perceptions and acceptance of risks, general motivations, attitudes and behaviors concerning electronic identity. Four behavioral paradoxes are identified in the analysis: a privacy paradox (to date well known), but also a control paradox, a responsibility paradox and an awareness paradox. The chapter then examines the paradoxes in relation of three main policy dilemmas framing the debate on digital identity. The paper concludes by arguing for an expanded identity debate spanning policy circles and the engineering community.","2010","2025-07-17 22:27:17","2025-07-17 22:27:17","","169-185","","","","","","The Policy Maker's Anguish","","","","","Springer US","Boston, MA","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Moore, Tyler; Pym, David; Ioannidis, Christos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This leads them inexorably towards having their IP address range visible in the global routing table, increasing the resource usage of every Internet router. Since this is essentially ‘free’, yet impacts the cost and stability of every router in the world, this is a classic ‘tragedy of the commons’. There is little prospect of change in the IPv4 world, but there is a chance to fix the problem as IPv6 is rolled out. Unfortunately, SHIM6, the engineering solution chosen to solve this issue in IPv6, will only be effective if universally adopted, and there are no short-term incentives to prefer SHIM6 over a duplication of the IPv4 arrangements. Incentives could be artificially introduced by requiring payment for adding multi-homed address space to the global routing table — a naïve estimate of the actual cost being $77 000 per routing prefix. However, it would be almost impossible to ensure the substantial revenues involved are correctly redistributed to those bearing the costs.","2010","2025-07-17 22:27:17","2025-07-17 22:27:17","","67-78","","","","","","Internet Multi-Homing Problems","","","","","Springer US","Boston, MA","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Moore, Tyler; Pym, David; Ioannidis, Christos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose, contrast and compare three metrics for measuring the price of uncertainty due to the departure from the payoff-optimal security outcomes under complete information. Per the analogy with other efficiency metrics, such as the price of anarchy, we define the price of uncertainty as the maximum discrepancy in expected payoff in a complete information environment versus the payoff in an incomplete information environment. We consider difference, payoffratio, and cost-ratio metrics as canonical nontrivial measurements of the price of uncertainty. We conduct an algebraic, numerical, and graphical analysis of these metrics applied to different well-studied security scenarios proposed in prior work (i.e., best shot, weakest-link, and total effort). In these scenarios, we study how a fully rational expert agent could utilize the metrics to decide whether to gather information about the economic incentives of multiple nearsighted and naïve agents. We find substantial differences between the various metrics and evaluate the appropriateness for security choices in networked systems.","2010","2025-07-17 22:27:17","2025-07-17 22:27:17","","9-32","","","","","","","","","","","Springer US","Boston, MA","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Moore, Tyler; Pym, David; Ioannidis, Christos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From an evaluation of 45 social networking sites using 260 criteria we find that many popular assumptions regarding privacy and social networking need to be revisited when considering the entire ecosystem instead of only a handful of well-known sites. Contrary to the common perception of an oligopolistic market, we find evidence of vigorous competition for new users. Despite observing many poor security practices, there is evidence that social network providers are making efforts to implement privacy enhancing technologies with substantial diversity in the amount of privacy control offered. However, privacy is rarely used as a selling point, even then only as auxiliary, nondecisive feature. Sites also failed to promote their existing privacy controls within the site. We similarly found great diversity in the length and content of formal privacy policies, but found an opposite promotional trend: though almost all policies are not accessible to ordinary users due to obfuscating legal jargon, they conspicuously vaunt the sites’ privacy practices. We conclude that the market for privacy in social networks is dysfunctional in that there is significant variation in sites’ privacy controls, data collection requirements, and legal privacy policies, but this is not effectively conveyed to users. Our empirical findings motivate us to introduce the novel model of a privacy communication game, where the economically rational choice for a site operator is to make privacy control available to evade criticism from privacy fundamentalists, while hiding the privacy control interface and privacy policy to maximize sign-up numbers and encourage data sharing from the pragmatic majority of users.","2010","2025-07-17 22:27:17","2025-07-17 22:27:17","","121-167","","","","","","The Privacy Jungle","","","","","Springer US","Boston, MA","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Moore, Tyler; Pym, David; Ioannidis, Christos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An often-cited reason why people fail to make rational decisions regarding their own informational privacy is the high uncertainty about future consequences of information disclosures today. This chapter builds an analogy to financial options and draws on principles of option pricing to account for this uncertainty in the valuation of privacy. For this purpose, the development of a data subject's personal attributes over time and the development of the attribute distribution in the population are modeled as two stochastic processes, which fit into the Binomial Option Pricing Model (BOPM). Possible applications of such valuation methods to guide decision support in future privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) are sketched.","2010","2025-07-17 22:27:17","2025-07-17 22:27:17","","187-209","","","","","","","","","","","Springer US","Boston, MA","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Moore, Tyler; Pym, David; Ioannidis, Christos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our model, a user's probability to incur damage (from being attacked) depends on both his security and the network security, with the latter taken by individual users as given. First, we consider cyberinsurers who cannot observe (and thus, affect) individual user security. This asymmetric information causes moral hazard. Then, for most parameters, no equilibrium exists: the insurance market is missing. Even if an equilibrium exists, the insurance contract covers only a minor fraction of the damage; network security worsens relative to the no-insurance equilibrium. Second, we consider insurers with perfect information about their users' security. Here, user security is perfectly enforceable (zero cost); each insurance contract stipulates the required user security. The unique equilibrium contract covers the entire user damage. Still, for most parameters, network security worsens relative to the no-insurance equilibrium. Although cyber-insurance improves user welfare, in general, competitive cyber-insurers fail to improve network security.","2010","2025-07-17 22:27:17","2025-07-17 22:27:17","","229-247","","","","","","","","","","","Springer US","Boston, MA","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Moore, Tyler; Pym, David; Ioannidis, Christos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we analyze the roles of the major actors within this ecosystem and the processes they participate in, and the the paths vulnerability data take through the ecosystem and the impact of each of these on security risk. Then, based on a quantitative examination of 27,000 vulnerabilities disclosed over the past decade and taken from publicly available data sources, we quantify the systematic gap between exploit and patch availability. We provide the first examination of the impact and the risks associated with this gap on the ecosystem as a whole. Our analysis provides a metric for the success of the “responsible disclosure” process. We measure the prevalence of the commercial markets for vulnerability information and highlight the role of security information providers (SIP), which function as the “free press” of the ecosystem.","2010","2025-07-17 22:27:17","2025-07-17 22:27:17","","79-106","","","","","","","","","","","Springer US","Boston, MA","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Moore, Tyler; Pym, David; Ioannidis, Christos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even though many security managers are skeptical about outsourcing of IT security, others have cited reasons thatare used for outsourcing of traditional IT functions for why security outsourcing is likely to increase. Our research offers a novel explanation, based on competitive externalities associated with IT security, for firms' decisions to outsource IT security. We show that if competitive externalities are ignored, then a firm will outsource security if and only if the MSSP offers a quality (or a cost) advantage over in-house operations, which is consistent with the traditional explanation for security outsourcing. However, a higher quality is neither a prerequisite nor a guarantee for a firm to outsource security. The competitive risk environment and the nature of the security function outsourced, in addition to quality, determine firms' outsourcing decisions. If the reward from the competitor's breach is higher than the loss from own breach, then even if the likelihood of a breach is higher under the MSSP the expected benefit from the competitive demand externality may offset the loss from the higher likelihood of breaches, resulting in one or both firms outsourcing security. The incentive to outsource security monitoring is higher than that of infrastructure management because the MSSP can reduce the likelihood of breach on both firms and thus enhance the demand externality effect. The incentive to outsource security monitoring (infrastructure management) is higher (lower) if either the likelihood of breach on both firms is lower (higher) when security is outsourced or the benefit (relative to loss) from the externality is higher (lower). The benefit from the demand externality arising out of a security breach is higher when more of the customers that leave the breached firm switch to the non-breached firm.","2010","2025-07-17 22:27:17","2025-07-17 22:27:17","","301-320","","","","","","","","","","","Springer US","Boston, MA","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Moore, Tyler; Pym, David; Ioannidis, Christos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, uncertainty limits the optimising behaviour which is often the focus of economic models and so people will be forced to rely on simpler decision-making rules when managing information online. Behavioural economics and economic psychology emphasise that people will make many mistakes in processing information and planning for the future and these mistakes will also distort learning processes. Emotions and visceral factors will play a key role - not only aﬀecting people’s actions and choices but also the connection between information, learning and choices.

Such entities may be represented by hackers or miscreants who might cause significant damage to data and other software or hardware resources of an organization. A Vulnerability is a general way of representing a weakness in the software or hardware resources of the computational infrastructure of an organization. Such vulnerabilities may be either minor software issues, or in some cases may expose vital computational resources of the organization to external threats. The first step is to scan the entire computational infrastructure for such vulnerabilities. Once they are ascertained, a patching process is carried out to mitigate the threats. In order to perform effective mitigation, the most serious vulnerabilities should be given a higher priority. In order to create this priority list, a scoring mechanism is required for all scanned vulnerabilities. We present an end to end deployed vulnerability management system which can score these vulnerabilities using a natural language description of the same.","2023","2025-07-17 22:28:30","2025-07-17 22:28:30","","97-113","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Arai, Kohei","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forskningsfeltet gir en bedre forståelse av hvorfor sikkerhetsbrudd fortsatt oppstår til tross for robuste tekniske tiltak, og sikkerhetsøkonomi gir et økonomisk rammeverk for å analysere cybersikkerhet. Sosial manipulasjon er kunsten å bruke manipulasjon og psykologisk overtalelse for å få folk til å kompromittere informasjonssystemer. Denne oppgaven ser på sosial manipulasjon fra en sikkerhetsøkonomisk kontekst, hvor de sikkerhetsøkonomiske konseptene som brukes hovedsakelig er eksternaliteter, feiljusterte insentiver og asymmetrisk informasjon. Disse konseptene brukes til å diskutere angrep som phishing, spoofing og Business Email Compromise (BEC). Denne oppgaven bruker en kvalitativ tilnærming basert på dybdeintervjuer for å innhente informasjon. Fem sikkerhetseksperter og fire ofre for sosiale manipulasjonsangrep er intervjuet. De innsamlede empiriske dataene brukes til å bidra til forståelsen av hvordan man håndterer sosiale manipulasjonsangrep, utfordre etablerte idéer som mennesket er det svakeste leddet, gi forklaringer på hvorfor tiltak mot sosial manipulasjon mislykkes i praksis, og utvide teorien om sikkerhetsøkonomi. Funnene avdekker nye perspektiver som vi argumenterer for at bør inkluderes i sikkerhetsøkonomi som fagfelt, hovedsakelig begrepene tillit, skam, åpenhet og kultur. Basert på empiriske data gir vi dessuten anbefalinger for å redusere antallet vellykkede angrep der sosial manipulasjon brukes.

Unfortunately, today's AI algorithms are known to be generally vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, for such AI component-level vulnerabilities to be semantically impactful at the system level, it needs to address non-trivial semantic gaps both (1) from the system-level attack input spaces to those at AI component level, and (2) from AI component-level attack impacts to those at the system level. In this paper, we define such research space as semantic AI security as opposed to generic AI security. Over the past 5 years, increasingly more research works are performed to tackle such semantic AI security challenges in AD context, which has started to show an exponential growth trend. In this paper, we perform the first systematization of knowledge of such growing semantic AD AI security research space. In total, we collect and analyze 53 such papers, and systematically taxonomize them based on research aspects critical for the security field. We summarize 6 most substantial scientific gaps observed based on quantitative comparisons both vertically among existing AD AI security works and horizontally with security works from closely-related domains. With these, we are able to provide insights and potential future directions not only at the design level, but also at the research goal, methodology, and community levels. To address the most critical scientific methodology-level gap, we take the initiative to develop an open-source, uniform, and extensible system-driven evaluation platform, named PASS, for the semantic AD AI security research community. We also use our implemented platform prototype to showcase the capabilities and benefits of such a platform using representative semantic AD AI attacks.","2024-04-26","2025-07-17 22:39:10","2025-07-17 22:39:10","2025-07-17 22:39:10","","","","","","","SoK","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2203.05314 [cs]","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\L2GK4K64\Shen et al. - 2024 - SoK On the Semantic AI Security in Autonomous Driving.pdf","","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Cryptography and Security; Computer Science - Robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2203.05314","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address these challenges, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) security service emerges as a promising solution. However, the complex service configurations and performance guarantees hinder the autonomous deployment of the AI security service. This paper proposes an autonomous deployment mechanism in Software-Defined Networking/Network Function Virtualization (SDN/NFV) enabled networks. First, our mechanism introduces user and decision planes on top of the control plane, enabling hierarchical intent expression and translation from user security intent to security policies. Then, we analyze the embedding problem of the AI-based Security Function Chain (AISFC) during security policy generation. We formulate the AISFC embedding problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task to minimize the total response delay. By decomposing it into AISF placement and routing, we design a heuristic algorithm with polynomial time complexity. Finally, we validate the proposed mechanism through a prototype system and numerical simulations, demonstrating its ability to autonomously translate, implement, and guarantee the user security intent. Comparative analysis shows that our approach considering the relationship between available computing resources and delay achieves smaller response delays than the baseline. Furthermore, our algorithm achieves a gap from optimality approximately 28.57% smaller than the greedy algorithm and supports networks that are 4.34 times larger in scale than the exact solution within a 2-second execution time.","2024","2025-07-17 22:40:11","2025-07-17 22:40:11","2025-07-17 22:40:11","4048-4062","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\SIUC6V89\Wang et al. - 2024 - An Autonomous Deployment Mechanism for AI Security Services.pdf","","","Analytical models; Artificial intelligence; Data models; Delays; intent-based network; network function virtualization; Network function virtualization; Routing; Security; security management; Security management; service function chain; Task analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This GCSP Strategic Security Analysis paper addresses the question of AI robustness when AI techniques and models are adopted in security systems. Robustness refers to the reliable operation of a system across a range of conditions (including attacks). Firstly, the distinction between AI and machine learning (ML) is highlighted, with reference to the Artificial Intelligence and UK National Security report.5 Whereas “general AI” refers to machine intelligence with the agency, reasoning and adaptability of a human brain, “narrow AI” refers to machine intelligence trained to perform narrowly defined cognitive tasks, such as playing chess, driving a car or translating documents. This paper addresses “narrow AI”, for which the terms AI and ML are used interchangeably.","2022-06-01","2025-07-17 22:40:46","2025-07-17 22:40:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Queen's University Belfast","","Publisher: Geneva Centre for Security Policy (GCSP)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, AI-based systems are generally vulnerable to various security threats throughout the whole process, ranging from the initial data collection and preparation to the training, inference, and final deployment. In an AI-based system, the data collection and pre-processing phase are vulnerable to sensor spoofing attacks and scaling attacks, respectively, while the training and inference phases of the model are subject to poisoning attacks and adversarial attacks, respectively. To address these severe security threats against the AI-based systems, in this article, we review the challenges and recent research advances for security issues in AI, so as to depict an overall blueprint for AI security.

AI systems are vulnerable to attack and unintentional failure. While there have yet to be catastrophic failures, there is significant policy attention to securing against the risk. This paper examines how AI cybersecurity has been constructed as a matter of concern to U.S. national security. Drawing on literature on the securitization of traditional cybersecurity and analyzing 58 U.S. policy documents on AI, this paper traces 3 factors in the securitization narrative: increased linkages to other domains; amplified speed, scale, autonomy, and complexity; and the expanded role of the private sector. Analysis found that: 1) Calls for security portray AI security as connected to broad domains through linkages to cybersecurity, critical infrastructure, civilian and societal systems, international power, and data; 2) Technical features of AI resonate with pre-existing political fears of complexity and narratives of cascading disaster scenarios; and 3) The government is highly dependent on the private sector to provision AI security. The combination of the technical features of AI, international policy windows, and linkages to many threat narratives would suggest that the likelihood of securitizing AI is high. However, the private sector is deeply embedded in the security narratives and providing the security solutions. As AI is incorporated further into cyber environment, securitization theory needs to reconcile with the role of the private sector as an inherent security actor. There will be need for increased analysis of the range of private sector actors and economic incentive alignment for AI security. The analysis and research were conducted in 2021 and the article written in 2022.","2022-10-13","2025-07-17 22:40:59","2025-07-17 22:40:59","2025-07-17 22:40:59","","","","","","","AI Vulnerability, National Security, and Private Sector Power","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence; Cyber Policy; Cybersecurity; Machine Learning; National Security; Securitization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5010934","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this challenge, we introduce the AI Security Pyramid of Pain, a framework that adapts the cybersecurity Pyramid of Pain to categorize and prioritize AI-specific threats. This framework provides a structured approach to understanding and addressing various levels of AI threats. Starting at the base, the pyramid emphasizes Data Integrity, which is essential for the accuracy and reliability of datasets and AI models, including their weights and parameters. Ensuring data integrity is crucial, as it underpins the effectiveness of all AI-driven decisions and operations. The next level, AI System Performance, focuses on MLOps-driven metrics such as model drift, accuracy, and false positive rates. These metrics are crucial for detecting potential security breaches, allowing for early intervention and maintenance of AI system integrity. Advancing further, the pyramid addresses the threat posed by Adversarial Tools, identifying and neutralizing tools used by adversaries to target AI systems. This layer is key to staying ahead of evolving attack methodologies. At the Adversarial Input layer, the framework addresses the detection and mitigation of inputs designed to deceive or exploit AI models. This includes techniques like adversarial patterns and prompt injection attacks, which are increasingly used in sophisticated attacks on AI systems. Data Provenance is the next critical layer, ensuring the authenticity and lineage of data and models. This layer is pivotal in preventing the use of compromised or biased data in AI systems. At the apex is the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) layer, dealing with the most complex and challenging aspects of AI security. This involves a deep understanding and strategic approach to counter advanced AI-targeted attacks, requiring comprehensive knowledge and planning. This paper provides an overview of each layer, discussing their significance and interplay within AI system security. The AI Security Pyramid of Pain offers a strategic approach for organizations to navigate and mitigate the multifaceted threats in AI security effectively.","2024-06-07","2025-07-17 22:41:04","2025-07-17 22:41:04","2025-07-17 22:41:04","44-53","","","13054","","","","","","","","SPIE","","","","","","","www.spiedigitallibrary.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Assurance and Security for AI-enabled Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, in this paper, we advocate that stakeholders in AI risk management should be aware of the nuances, synergies, and interplay between safety and security, and unambiguously take into account the perspectives of both disciplines in order to devise mostly effective and holistic risk mitigation approaches. Unfortunately, this vision is often obfuscated, as the definitions of the basic concepts of ""safety"" and ""security"" themselves are often inconsistent and lack consensus across communities.

With the advent of advanced technologies like machine learning and natural language processing, conversational AI has become capable of performing complex tasks, including processing customer requests, providing recommendations, and facilitating transactions. However, these systems are also vulnerable to various security risks that can expose sensitive data and compromise the privacy of users. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the risks associated with conversational AI security, including attacks such as phishing, malware injection, and voice cloning. The paper also discusses the potential impact of these attacks on businesses and end-users and proposes strategies to mitigate these risks [1]. Conversational AI is a rapidly growing field, with a wide range of applications such as customer service, personal assistants, and healthcare. However, with the increasing use of conversational AI, there are also growing concerns about the security risks associated with these systems. This research paper aims to explore the risks associated with conversational AI security, including privacy breaches, data leakage, and manipulation of conversational agents. This paper also discusses the current state of research in this area and proposes recommendations for improving conversational AI security. Conversational AI has gained significant popularity in recent years due to its ability to enable natural and seamless interactions between humans and machines. However, with the increasing use of conversational AI, the risks for security have also increased. The risks for conversational AI security include both technical and non-technical threats that can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information. This paper provides an overview of the risks associated with conversational AI security, including threats such as data breaches, malicious attacks, impersonation attacks, and social engineering attacks. It also discusses the measures that can be taken to mitigate these risks, including implementing secure authentication mechanisms, using encryption, monitoring user behavior, and adopting a risk management approach. Ultimately, understanding the risks for conversational AI security is crucial for organizations to develop effective security strategies and protect their sensitive information from potential threats.","2024","2025-07-17 22:45:42","2025-07-17 22:45:42","2025-07-17 22:45:42","557-587","","","","","","","","","","","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","en","© 2024 Scrivener Publishing LLC","","","","Wiley Online Library","","Section: 32 _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781394200801.ch32 DOI: 10.1002/9781394200801.ch32","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\JQYIXV4F\9781394200801.html","","","Chatbots; Conversational AI; machine learning (ML); natural language processing; virtual assistants; voice assistants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This review proposes a comprehensive governance framework model that integrates the roles of artificial intelligence (AI), security, compliance, and management to enhance the effectiveness of cloud operations. AI plays a critical role in optimizing resource allocation and improving decision-making processes within cloud governance. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, organizations can achieve dynamic resource management, predictive analytics, and automated compliance monitoring, which enhance operational efficiency and reduce human error. Furthermore, the integration of AI in security management facilitates real-time threat detection and response, allowing organizations to proactively mitigate risks associated with data breaches and cyberattacks. Security is a paramount concern in cloud governance, given the shared responsibility model between cloud providers and clients. This framework emphasizes the implementation of comprehensive security measures, including data encryption, identity management, and incident response protocols, to safeguard sensitive information and maintain customer trust. Compliance with regulatory requirements is essential in ensuring organizational accountability and minimizing legal risks. The proposed governance model incorporates automated compliance checks and reporting mechanisms, ensuring adherence to industry-specific regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Moreover, effective management of cloud resources is crucial for optimizing performance and controlling costs. The governance framework outlines best practices for lifecycle management, cost optimization, and resource allocation, enabling organizations to achieve their strategic objectives.

Although many video games for education in cybersecurity have been designed, we have two problems for education in AI security: a helpful design of a video game for users to learn cybersecurity is still unclear, and there is no game for AI security, to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we design a video game for education in AI security, REN-A.I., to address the above problems. In designing REN-A.I., we built some hypotheses: simulating damage caused by attacks on AI and the effectiveness of their countermeasures through a video game helps a user to improve awareness of AI security with the episodic memory of the user itself. We focus on game scenarios and game functionalities to learn AI security with episodic memory in accordance with the above hypothesis. We conducted a questionnaire survey with 48 users to evaluate REN-A.I.. As a result, we confirm that both game scenarios and game functionalities are effective for learning with episodic memory. Specifically, 74% of users consider game scenarios effective, and 81% of users consider game functionalities effective. Our survey results have revealed two suggestions for beneficial design aspects in video games for education in cybersecurity. In particular, users who read game scenarios in REN-A.I. can learn AI security by the game more effectively than the other users. Furthermore, the functionality for accuracy deterioration due to attacks in REN-A.I. is effective even for users who do not read the game scenario.

Next generation (NextG) communication systems are beginning to explore shifting this design paradigm to reliably executing a given task, such as in task-oriented communications. In this article, wireless signal classification is considered as the task for the NextG Radio Access Network (RAN), where edge devices collect wireless signals for spectrum awareness and communicate with the NextG base station (gNodeB) that needs to identify the signal label. Edge devices may not have sufficient processing power and may not be trusted to perform the signal classification task, whereas the transfer of signals to the gNodeB may not be feasible due to stringent delay, rate, and energy restrictions. Task-oriented communications is considered by jointly training the transmitter, receiver, and classifier functionalities as an encoder-decoder pair for the edge device and the gNodeB. This approach improves the accuracy compared to the separated case of signal transfer followed by classification.

Taking care of the security of AI systems is therefore viewed in AI ethics as an important part of ensuring that central values such as safety or personal privacy are not jeopardised by AI systems. However, this view of AI security oversimplifies its relationship with AI ethics, as there are also situations where security may need to be traded off against another ethics requirement or where the exploitation of an AI vulnerability can be argued to be ethically justified. To provide a more nuanced view, the paper reviews the conception of security as an ethics principle in a selection of AI ethics guides and examines some notable cases where a tension exists between security and some other AI ethics principle. Furthermore, the existence of vulnerabilities in AI systems does not directly translate into harm, so it is important to distinguish theoretical scenarios involving AI vulnerabilities from their actual real-world impact. To gauge the impact, a search targeting six different incident repositories was carried out; it was observed that such efforts are hindered by the concept of AI vulnerability being vaguely defined and by the lack of a good repository that would allow exploration of AI incidents specifically involving exploitation of vulnerabilities. The search yielded only a very small number of relevant incidents, which is taken to indicate that the scale of the problem is currently small. However, it is also recognised that there is likely to be some number of incidents that the search missed, either because they were not included in the databases searched or because the search method failed to find them.","2024-11-07","2025-07-17 22:47:34","2025-07-17 22:47:34","2025-07-17 22:47:34","","","","","","","What Is an AI Vulnerability, and Why Should We Care?","","","","","","","eng","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","A4","","","","","Accepted: 2025-01-21T06:53:00Z Publisher: RWTH Aachen","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\NIFKBK7M\Tuovinen and Halunen - 2024 - What Is an AI Vulnerability, and Why Should We Care Unpacking the Relationship Between AI Security.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"FH4VPGWM","thesis","2023","Chattopadhyay, Nandish","Robust AI: security and privacy issues in machine learning","","","","","https://hdl.handle.net/10356/165248","Machine learning based decision making can be adopted in practice as a driver of most applications only when there are strong guarantees on its reliability. The trust of those involved as stakeholders needs to be established for making it more ubiquitous and acceptable. In general, the idea of reliability in machine learning can be construed as a sum of two parts, Robustness and Resilience. Since reliability is concerned about providing assurances against malfunctions or errors, it can also be classified based on the types of those errors. This thesis deals with Robustness, that is robustness against attacks, which are responsible for generating intentional and malicious errors. The robustness is therefore to be studied in conjunction with the mechanisms an adversary may adopt to disrupt the machine learning application.  To investigate and understand Robustness in ML algorithms against various forms of attacks, we break down each into components and consider all possible combinations. Typically, Robustness is studied with respect to security and privacy aspects. The ML algorithm itself comprises of the trained model and the training data. Therefore, we consider security and privacy related problems pertaining to both components of ML, that is the model and the data. It may be noted here that the work touches upon many important problems in this regard, but it is not exhaustive. We consider all problems related to attacks that jeopardize the fundamental ML task itself under the umbrella of security issues and those that deal with attacks leaking secret and sensitive information about the system under privacy.   The primary vulnerability of machine learning models with respect to security is adversarial attacks. In the first part, we consider security for models, and study the adversarial attacks through the lens of dimensionality. We assert that the high dimensional landscape in which the neural network models optimize facilitate the generation of adversarial examples and that dimensionality reduction enhances adversarial robustness. We have explored the mathematical background for this proposition, studying the properties of data distributions in the high dimensional spaces and nature of such trained manifolds. The idea has been empirically justified thereafter. We have extended this notion of the influence of dimensionality on adversarial sample generation from images to videos and text and provided practical and efficient solutions by leveraging adversarial samples detection and dimensionality reduction. It is important to note here that reducing the dimensionality has an additional computational cost and can in some cases also have an adverse effect on the fundamental machine learning task itself. We therefore optimise the dimension reduction operation for each of the tasks and use-cases and carefully choose the amount of variability to preserve that effectively eliminates adversarial noise but retains the meaningful information necessary for classification or object detection etc. Additionally, in one of the works, we make use of a parallel channel to run the classifications task and adversarial sample detection and apply dimensionality reduction to only those samples that are detected as adversarial. This significantly improves efficiency of the overall system and proves to be beneficial in terms of accuracy as well.   Thereafter, we study the security flaw of adversarial attacks from the perspective of vulnerable features within the data. We have analysed spatially correlated patterns within adversarial images. Class wise, we have split images into two key parts, Region of Importance (RoI) and Region of Attack (RoA), such that the RoI is the region that the classifier is particularly sensitive to, during the classification task, and the RoA is the region which the adversarial attack modifies. The goal of this exercise was to figure out areas within the images that do not contribute to the task of classification but are adversarially vulnerable. Our proposed adversarial defence mechanism out of this work is to neutralize that region, therefore bringing down adversarial vulnerability without compromising on classification accuracy. The idea is demonstrated through benchmarking datasets and models.  Moving on to the aspect of privacy in the second part, we look at some very different problems. First, we look at privacy for the models, followed by that of the data. In the context of preserving privacy of the trained neural network models, we direct our attention to protecting ownership and IP rights of the models, using watermarking. We review the state-of-the-art in watermarking schemes for neural networks and select the most appropriate ones to study. Watermarking using backdooring is the scheme of choice here. We investigate the vulnerabilities of this scheme and break it using synthesis. In our proposition titled Re-Markable, we make the assumption that the adversary has very limited compute power and access to samples from the data distribution relevant to the task. We train a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) to synthesize more samples and use the synthesized samples to re-train just the fully connected layers of the watermarked models. As demonstrated, it turns out that this minimal computation is sufficient to eliminate the presence of embedded watermarks from the model, and this vulnerability makes the existing scheme extremely unreliable. To solve the problem thus discovered, we worked on a robust watermarking scheme that overcomes this vulnerability. ROWBACK, or robust watermarking for neural networks using backdooring, uses a redesigned mechanism for generating the Trigger Set (using adversarial examples with explicit labelling) that is used as the private key for the watermarking, and a method of explicitly marking every layer of the neural network with the embedded watermarks. The goal is to ensure that an adversary interested in extracting the network would need to re-train every layer of the model, which is as good as training a fresh model from scratch as it would require extensive training samples and compute power. We also extended the idea of robust watermarking for models in the domain of natural language processing, particularly text classifiers. TextBack, designed to embed watermarks within text classifiers using backdooring, uses a marking scheme that involves the Trigger samples and clean samples together, unlike that in images, as this property is observed only in sequential models like recurrent neural networks and LSTM based models.   Finally, to cover the aspect of privacy of data, we focus on collaborative ML. The motivation in this work is to protect the privacy of the data that is used for training, as many practical applications necessitate the usage of highly sensitive data. This data is decentralised, resides with different non-collocated entities, and is not sharable on privacy grounds. The straight-forward solution to this problem is available in the literature in the form of Federated Learning. Additionally, an adversary may tap into the federated learning infrastructure in multiple ways and extract information. For example, Membership Inference attacks are possible on models deployed in the cloud (which is natural in many federated learning setups), wherein the model could be queried multiple times and based on the output probabilities returned by the model, one can train another separate model to know if the particular input that had been sent as the query belonged to the training set or not. Carrying out this process multiple times can in theory lead to the reverse-engineering of the entire training set. This is a serious privacy violation. We attempted to solve this problem using Differential Privacy, where a differentially private learning algorithm is used by the participants of the federated learning infrastructure for their local training, involving gradient trimming and addition of sampled noise. We studied practical applications of such collaborative learning systems and deployed the framework on edge devices, by creating light-weight versions of the models that do not compromise on accuracy. Similarly, in another use-case, the participants of the federated learning setup itself could have malicious intentions and can come up with sabotaging attacks on the learning framework. Considering such potential single points of failures of the overall system, we proposed a robust federated learning infrastructure, that assigns coefficients to the updates sent by the clients to the server. This takes care of tolerating faults in up to 50% of the clients’ failures.  Overall, the ideas discussed in this thesis are a major step towards making machine learning systems more robust and is therefore a necessary step in the direction of reliable AI.","2023","2025-07-17 22:48:07","2025-07-17 22:48:07","2025-07-17 22:48:07","","","","","","","Robust AI","","","","","Nanyang Technological University","","en","","","","","dr.ntu.edu.sg","","DOI: 10.32657/10356/165248","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GAI technology provides an effective way for them to address these issues in an automated manner with increasing efficiency. It enables them to work on more critical security aspects which require human intervention, while GAI systems deal with general threat situations. Further, GAI systems can better detect novel malware and threatening situations than humans. This feature of GAI, when leveraged, can lead to higher robustness of the security system. Many tech giants like Google, Microsoft etc., are motivated by this idea and are incorporating elements of GAI in their cybersecurity systems to make them more efficient in dealing with ever-evolving threats. Many cybersecurity tools like Google Cloud Security AI Workbench, Microsoft Security Copilot, SentinelOne Purple AI etc., have come into the picture, which leverage GAI to develop more straightforward and robust ways to deal with emerging cybersecurity perils. With the advent of GAI in the cybersecurity domain, one also needs to take into account the limitations and drawbacks that such systems have.

As cyber threats become increasingly complex, AI offers powerful tools for identifying, mitigating, and preventing attacks in real-time. AI-driven systems excel at processing vast amounts of data, detecting anomalies, and identifying patterns that traditional security systems might miss. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms enhance the ability to predict potential threats, reducing response time and improving the accuracy of threat detection. These capabilities make AI a valuable asset in addressing sophisticated threats such as zero-day vulnerabilities, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and ransomware attacks. In the realm of security compliance, AI plays a pivotal role by automating routine tasks such as monitoring, auditing, and reporting. This reduces the burden on organizations to manually enforce regulatory standards, leading to more efficient compliance with frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. AI can continuously assess systems to ensure that they meet compliance requirements, enhancing the ability to detect and respond to violations. Furthermore, AI contributes to governance by helping organizations develop robust security policies, track compliance metrics, and streamline incident response. However, the integration of AI in cybersecurity also presents challenges, including adversarial AI, data privacy concerns, and transparency in AI decision-making processes. Additionally, AI-driven attacks are an emerging threat that necessitates further research and regulation. Despite these challenges, the future of AI in cybersecurity and compliance looks promising, with advancements in predictive analytics, quantum computing, and autonomous security systems poised to further revolutionize the field. As AI technologies evolve, they will continue to play a critical role in fortifying cybersecurity defenses and ensuring regulatory compliance across industries.","2024-10-30","2025-07-17 22:48:24","2025-07-17 22:48:24","2025-07-17 22:48:24","167-184","","1","21","","Global J.

Machine Learning (ML) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), while enabling advanced decision-making capabilities, are susceptible to a range of threats, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and model exploitation. These vulnerabilities not only compromise system integrity but also pose significant risks in applications such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. This paper explores a comprehensive framework for ensuring the security of ML and RL models, emphasizing proactive and reactive strategies. We begin by identifying common attack vectors in ML and RL, illustrating real-world examples of security breaches. A taxonomy of these threats is presented, categorizing them based on their origin, impact, and detectability. Building on this, the paper highlights cutting-edge techniques for securing AI models, including robust model architectures, adversarial training, differential privacy, and federated learning. The role of explainable AI (XAI) in uncovering potential vulnerabilities is also examined, alongside mechanisms for enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, the unique challenges posed by RL systems, such as the exploitation of reward mechanisms and policy manipulation, are discussed. Solutions tailored to RL, including dynamic reward shaping and environment-aware defenses, are proposed. The paper also delves into regulatory and ethical considerations, advocating for standardized frameworks and cross-industry collaboration to ensure AI safety. By integrating theoretical insights with practical recommendations, this study provides a roadmap for researchers and practitioners to fortify ML and RL systems against evolving threats. The ultimate goal is to foster trust and resilience in AI technologies, ensuring their safe deployment in diverse domains.","2020","2025-07-17 22:48:32","2025-07-17 22:48:32","","","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\R84K49UI\Shah - 2020 - Towards Safe AI Ensuring Security in Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning Models.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this position paper, we argue that specific taxonomies are required to describe and report security incidents of AI systems. In other words, existing frameworks for either non-AI security or generic AI safety incident reporting are insufficient to capture the specific properties of AI security. To demonstrate our position, we offer an AI security incident taxonomy and highlight relevant properties, such as machine readability and integration with existing frameworks.

IoT is a network of hardware and software systems based on internet services and communication technology. IoT devices are fast increasing in popularity, creating a significant impact on our daily routines and businesses, healthcare, and transportation when making decisions. AI is based on models, and it is used to make decisions. The use of AI and IoT in the 5G network is to improve the infrastructure. In AI systems, there are three keys to work: AI input data, AI actually within the network, and AI outputs. And once the data collected from IoT devices are transferred to data analysis the results of these processes are useful in in-depth personal recommendations and lead to smart and efficient use. IoT is used to protect the information, which the object can give a unique identifier. This abstract explores a collection of art reviews focusing on the intricate relationship between security, privacy, AI and IoT. The art reviews on security and privacy for AI and IoT underscore the urgent need to address the associated challenges and risks. They explore encryption techniques, access controls and secure communication protocols for maintaining the integrity of artistic creations while preserving the privacy of both artists and audiences. By promoting a comprehensive understanding of the risks and opportunities inherent in AI and IoT driven art, we hope to shape of a future where artistic expression is in a secure and privacy-respecting environment.

In our society, many intelligent devices rely on AI/ML/DL algorithms/tools for smart operations. Although AI/ML/DL algorithms and tools have been used in many internet applications and electronic devices, they are also vulnerable to various attacks and threats. AI parameters may be distorted by the internal attacker; the DL input samples may be polluted by adversaries; the ML model may be misled by changing the classification boundary, among many other attacks and threats. Such attacks can make AI products dangerous to use.While this discussion focuses on security issues in AI/ML/DL-based systems (i.e., securing the intelligent systems themselves), AI/ML/DL models and algorithms can actually also be used for cyber security (i.e., the use of AI to achieve security).Since AI/ML/DL security is a newly emergent field, many researchers and industry professionals cannot yet obtain a detailed, comprehensive understanding of this area. This book aims to provide a complete picture of the challenges and solutions to related security issues in various applications. It explains how different attacks can occur in advanced AI tools and the challenges of overcoming those attacks. Then, the book describes many sets of promising solutions to achieve AI security and privacy. The features of this book have seven aspects: This is the first book to explain various practical attacks and countermeasures to AI systems Both quantitative math models and practical security implementations are provided It covers both ""securing the AI system itself"" and ""using AI to achieve security"" It covers all the advanced AI attacks and threats with detailed attack models It provides multiple solution spaces to the security and privacy issues in AI tools The differences among ML and DL security and privacy issues are explained Many practical security applications are covered","2023-06-05","2025-07-17 22:50:13","2025-07-17 22:50:13","","","347","","","","","AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning","","","","","CRC Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 6KEIEQAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.com.au/books?id=6KEIEQAAQBAJ","","Computers / Artificial Intelligence / General; Computers / Information Technology; Computers / Machine Theory; Computers / Networking / General; Computers / Programming / Algorithms; Computers / Security / General; Computers / Security / Network Security; Computers / Software Development & Engineering / Systems Analysis & Design; Law / Computer & Internet; Mathematics / Arithmetic; Technology & Engineering / Automation; Technology & Engineering / Electrical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that increasing Internet security risk in combination with the need for compliance with recent corporate legislation has contributed significantly to the demand for cyberinsurance. Cyberinsurance policies have become more comprehensive as insurers better understand the risk landscape and specific business needs. More specifically, cyberinsurers are addressing what used to be considered insurmountable problems (e.g., adverse selection/asymmetric information, moral hazard, etc.) that could lead to a failure of this market solution.

Internet security is a shared resource and as such it is affected by the “tragedy of the commons” whereby inactions by some users cause their computers to consume more Internet resources and this causes further deterioration of the network. For example, why should the rest of the Internet continue to suffer because some users have yet to patch their computers from the Code Red worm of many years ago? We propose that the cost of Internet security should be the responsibility of the individual users and a sum of money should be held in deposit for every user of the Internet before they are allowed to join the network and this should be forfeited if inaction from these users then cause network degradation.","2011-02-14","2025-07-17 23:58:50","2025-07-17 23:58:50","2025-07-17 23:58:50","","","11","1","","JBER","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","Publisher: Clute Institute","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\YRKD3J9K\Rose and Gordon - 2011 - Internet Security And The Tragedy Of The Commons.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While paying the ransom allows the user to quickly unlock the locked ﬁles and avoid potentially larger losses, it also strengthens the hands of the attacker and increases the chance of a future attack. We study this dilemma of the victims and the externality posed by their actions using a game-theoretic model on top of a Markov decision process. The resulting equilibrium leads to several interesting insights such as that legally prohibiting ransom payments may not always have the desired economic eﬀects—in some cases, a ban may be eﬀective in addressing the economic externality but, in others, it could reduce public welfare. Our ﬁndings have important implications for policymakers who are currently debating legislation that, if enacted, will outlaw ransom payments to attackers.","2021","2025-07-17 23:58:53","2025-07-17 23:58:53","2025-07-17 23:58:53","","","","","","","","","","","","Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","","en","","","","","Crossref","","ISSN: 2572-6862","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\E7KPXJCK\Dey and Lahiri - 2021 - Should We Outlaw Ransomware Payments.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, software vendors have little incentive to improve the security quality of their products because they are not directly liable for losses incurred due to poor security. The concept of software liability has been intensely discussed by computer scientists and jurists for years as a possible solution for improving software security. This paper examines a risk-sharing mechanism between a software vendor and its customers as a way to implement software liability. It considers both the software vendor's incentive to share risks with customers and the question of whether risk-sharing leads to better software security. The model provides evidence of underprovided security quality under monopoly with complete information, as has been observed in the market. The policy implications of the risk-sharing mechanism and the possible impact of competition on software vendors' incentive for risk-sharing are examined. Information asymmetry is found to be a key factor in voluntary risk-sharing under monopoly; the risk-sharing level can be a signal of unobservable security quality.","2009-12-01","2025-07-17 23:59:08","2025-07-17 23:59:08","2025-07-17 23:59:08","7-40","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.2753/JEC1086-4415140201","","","","","Economics of IS; information asymmetry; security policies; software liability; software security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Loopholes and vulnerabilities are not only the main reasons but lack of good incentives is also the main driving force behind information security breaches. Lack of information-sharing practice among industries and firms regarding security breaches will force the same to invest in security-providing tools and methods in a way that marginal costs become almost equal to marginal benefits.

Prior work on this topic assumes that the hacker’s effort is independent of the vendor’s decision to release the patch freely or not. Clearly, if the patch is not available to everyone, the hacker finds it easier to exploit the vulnerability in the product and, as a result, is likely to alter his effort. To understand the role of a strategic hacker, we build a game-theoretic model, where the hacker’s decision is endogenous. With this model, we find that the hacker’s effort may, on the one hand, decrease the utility that the vendor can extract from the consumers but, on the other hand, may help differentiate the legal version of the product from the pirated version. A vendor can strategically exploit the hacker’s behavior in its pricing and software maintenance decisions. The endogeneity of the hacker’s actions drives several of our findings that have interesting policy implications. For example, the vendor may increase the price and reduce market share to exploit the differentiation. In such a case, there may be more pirates in the restricted-patch case than when the patch is freely available, a result that runs counter to typical arguments provided for restricting patches.

"YFCWN4JH","journalArticle","","Dey, Debabrata; Zhang, Guoying","Impact of Network Externality in the Security Software Market","","","","","","The market for security software has witnessed an unprecedented growth in recent years. A closer examination of this market reveals certain idiosyncrasies that are not observed in a traditional software market. For example, it is a highly competitive market involving several major vendors, often with a very aggressive pricing strategy adopted by new entrants. Yet, the market coverage seems to be quite low. Prior research has not attempted to explain what aspects of security software make this market deviate from the traditional ones. In this paper, we develop a quantitative model to study this market. Our model identiﬁes the primary reason behind this behavior—that of a negative network externality eﬀect, which pulls the market in exactly the opposite direction when compared to the positive network externality observed in traditional software markets. Using our model, we ﬁrst show that a monopoly security software market has a lower market coverage, a higher price, and a higher revenue compared to a traditional monopoly market. We then extend our analysis to an oligopoly competition. There is a unique symmetric equilibrium in the oligopoly competition, and we ﬁnd that the number of vendors in the security software market tends to be larger than that in a traditional market. We also consider the eﬀect of a new entry in an oligopoly market. Next, we evaluate the strategy of vertical diﬀerentiation. We ﬁnd that, while this strategy is not desired by a monopolist, it may be adopted in a duopoly competition if the cost of development is suﬃciently high, although the feasible region for diﬀerentiation is more restricted than in a traditional market. Finally, we consider two extensions to the model to account for two other possible types of network externality and ﬁnd that our results hold in these extended models as well. Overall, our results highlight the unique nature of the security software market, furnish rigorous explanation for several counter-intuitive observations in the real world, and provide managerial insights for vendors on market competition and product development strategies.","","2025-07-17 23:59:34","2025-07-17 23:59:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\97N3UKNW\Dey and Zhang - Impact of Network Externality in the Security Software Market.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As distributed systems are assembled from machines belonging to principals with divergent interests, incentives are becoming as important to dependability as technical design. The new field provides valuable insights not just into ‘security’ topics such as privacy, bugs, spam, and phishing, but into more general areas such as system dependability (the design of peer-to-peer systems and the optimal balance of effort by programmers and testers), and policy (particularly digital rights management). This research program has been starting to spill over into more general security questions (such as law-enforcement strategy), and into the interface between security and sociology. Most recently it has started to interact with psychology, both through the psychology-and-economics tradition and in response to phishing. The promise of this research program is a novel framework for analyzing information security problems – one that is both principled and effective.","2007","2025-07-17 23:59:52","2025-07-17 23:59:52","","68-91","","","","","","","","","","","Springer","Berlin, Heidelberg","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\8GY2KP35\Anderson and Moore - 2007 - Information Security Economics – and Beyond.pdf","","","Information Security; Network Externality; Price Discrimination; Security Breach; Security Mechanism","Menezes, Alfred","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the recent years we observe the emerging of “vulnerability markets” as means to stimulate exchange of information. However, this term subsumes a broad range of different concepts, which are prone to confusion.

We examine structural results explaining the reasons firms join an MSSP network, and characterize the growth of MSSP network size under different forms of ownership (monopoly versus consortium). We find that the need for an initial investment in MSSP networks (which is necessary to overcome the stalling effect) only affects the optimal network size for a consortium but has no impact on the optimal network size for a profit-maximizing monopolist. Our results provide an explanation why the majority of the MSSPs are for-profit entities and consortium-based MSSPs are less common.

Huge investments have been made and even the regulators have taken information security seriously. Majority of current efforts both at the operational and the regulatory level, however, address only symptoms of an underlying problem: the insecurity of the software products - the salient components of most information and software systems. Secure software development has gained momentum during the past couple of years and improvements have been made. By analysing the incentives for secure software development, it is argued in this study that without appropriate regulatory intervention the level of security will not improve to meet the needs of the network society as a whole. Beside information security in general, secure software development has to be raised as an important public policy if we wish to achieve a more secure network society and to maintain trust for information products and systems in commerce. Efficacious regulatory measures are desperately needed to change the current practices. This study analyses two of the most attractive alternatives, software product liability and disclosure of vulnerability information, and makes suggestions for their improvement.","2006","2025-07-18 03:41:30","2025-07-18 03:41:30","2025-07-18 03:41:30","","","","","","","Regulating secure software development","","","","","fi=Lapin yliopisto|en=University of Lapland|","","en","openAccess","doctoralThesis","","","lauda.ulapland.fi","","Accepted: 2011-01-13T10:40:52Z ISBN: 9789524840538 ISSN: 1796-6310","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\46PADVKN\Råman - 2006 - Regulating secure software development  analysing the potential regulatory solutions for the lack o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our analysis of private intermediaries’ role suggests that public intermediary’s optimal disclosure time does not change with private intermediary’s participation. However, a vendor’s patch time increases when the probability of information leakage is low, if not non-existent. In other words, private intermediaries’ service decreases a vendor’s willingness to deliver quick patches.

However, little is known on the incentives set by bug bounty programs – how they drive engagement and new bug discoveries. This article provides an empirical investigation of the strategic interactions among the managers and participants of bug bounty programs, as well as the intermediation by bug bounty platforms. We find that for a given bug bounty program, each security researcher can only expect to discover a bounded number of bugs. This result offers a validation step to a theory brought forth early on by Brady et al. This theory proposes that each security researcher inspecting a piece of software offers a unique environment of skills and mindset, which is amenable to the discovery of bugs that others may not be able to uncover. Bug bounty programs indeed benefit from the engagement of large crowds of researchers. Conversely, security researchers benefit greatly from searching for bugs in multiple bug bounty programs. However, we find that following a strong front-loading effect, newly launched programs attract researchers at the expense of older programs: the probability of finding bugs decays as ∼1/t0.4 after the launch of a program, even though bugs found later yield on average higher rewards. Our results lead us to formulate three recommendations for organizing bug bounty programs and platforms: (i) organize enrollment, mobility, and renewal of security researchers across bounty programs, (ii) highlight and organize programs for front-loading, and (iii) organize fluid market transactions to reduce uncertainty and thus reduce incentives for security researchers to sell on the black market.","2017-06-01","2025-07-18 03:41:42","2025-07-18 03:41:42","2025-07-18 03:41:42","81-90","","2","3","","Journal of Cybersecurity","Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow?","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\TinyAIs\Zotero\storage\6I3FUWWQ\Maillart et al. - 2017 - Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow Revisiting Eric Raymond with bug bounty programs.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An often-cited reason why people fail to make rational decisions regarding their own informational privacy is the high uncertainty about future consequences of information disclosures today. This chapter builds an analogy to financial options and draws on principles of option pricing to account for this uncertainty in the valuation of privacy. For this purpose, the development of a data subject's personal attributes over time and the development of the attribute distribution in the population are modeled as two stochastic processes, which fit into the Binomial Option Pricing Model (BOPM). Possible applications of such valuation methods to guide decision support in future privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) are sketched.","2010","2025-07-18 03:41:47","2025-07-18 03:41:47","","187-209","","","","","","","","","","","Springer US","Boston, MA","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Moore, Tyler; Pym, David; Ioannidis, Christos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigates how AI-driven changes affect employees, with a focus on job stability, stress levels, anxiety, and burnout. A quantitative, cross-sectional survey was conducted among 300 employees from various AI-integrated industries. The results revealed that AI exposure is negatively correlated with job security (r = -0.65, p &lt; .01) and positively correlated with stress levels (r = 0.72, p &lt; .01), anxiety (r = 0.58, p &lt; .01), and burnout (r = 0.54, p &lt; .01).

We develop an analytical model to examine how an artificial intelligence (AI) cloud service provider optimally sets security investments and price discounts, considering users' different views of public, private, and hybrid AI cloud services. Our results show how end users' characteristics and market dynamics affect these strategies and reveal the balance providers must strike between improving user experiences, capturing market share, and maximizing profits. We find that the provider's control over AI cloud security—along with security costs for both the provider and users, as well as users' potential security losses—plays a critical role in shaping effective strategies. In low-security-loss environments, end users gain more from choosing public AI cloud solutions. However, private AI cloud solutions become more favorable if the provider's security cost coefficient falls within certain limits. In the hybrid AI cloud scenario, the model becomes more complex. Under some conditions, security investment and price discounts act as complementary strategies; in others, they substitute for one another. We also analyze how these choices affect market share and profitability, and find that in some cases, security investments can outperform price discounts.","2025-06-01","2025-07-18 04:07:50","2025-07-18 04:07:50","2025-07-18 04:07:50","109605","","","284","","International Journal of Production Economics","Optimal security and pricing strategies for AI cloud service providers","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","AI cloud service supply chain; Hybrid AI cloud; Price discount; Security effort","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
